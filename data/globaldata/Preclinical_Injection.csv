ARX-8203 is given by oral route for the treatment of systemic inflammation.;ARX-8203 is a prodrug of a well-known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs with analgesic and antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects and which have, in higher doses, anti-inflammatory effects. Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. NSAIDs work to block the effect of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase. This enzyme is critical in body's production of prostaglandins. It is prostaglandins that cause swelling and pain in a condition such as arthritis or bursitis. Therefore by interfering with cyclooxygenase, the drug candidate decreases the production of prostaglandins, and decrease pain and swelling associated with these conditions. COX catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs with analgesic and antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects and which have, in higher doses, anti-inflammatory effects. Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. NSAIDs work to block the effect of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase. This enzyme is critical in body's production of prostaglandins.

New research data presented at the international conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics reveal that BAL27862 has impressive activity against a panel of non small cell lung cancer cell lines, including patient-derived tumor cells resistant to paclitaxel. A detailed analysis demonstrates a dominant effect of BAL27862 on microtubules that is clearly distinct from that seen with microtubule-targeting agents currently used in clinical practice. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that BAL27862 is efficiently distributed to tissues in a mouse model of human cancer, with excellent tumor as well as brain penetration. Potent activity was observed against glioblastoma cell lines associated with a dramatic increase in tumor cell death Pre-clinical data confirm that BAL27862 suppresses microtubule dynamics in living cancer cells. Furthermore, the distinct microtubule phenotype induced by BAL27862 is associated with an apparent severing of the microtubules leading to their fragmentation. The studies further demonstrate that BAL27862 has broad activity against a panel of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines resistant to currently marketed microtubule-targeted therapeutics. BAL27862 not only overcomes P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance, but also resistance related to modifications in the expression of proteins involved in tumor cell survival and microtubule function, respectively. The distinct microtubule phenotype and anticancer profile associated with BAL27862 supports evaluation in cancer patients with treatment-refractory tumors.

B-17 is an irreversible ErbB-2 selective kinase inhibitor. B-17 is administered intraperitoneally. B-17 is a small molecule kinase inhibitors selective for ErbB-2. ErbB-2 is a therapeutic target with clinically proven outcome for the treatment of breast cancer. Thus, by inhibiting ErbB-2, B-17 may be useful for the treatment of breast cancer.;B-17 is a highly promising lead compound for the treatment of human breast cancer with over-expression of erbB-2. B-17 is erbB-2 selective small molecule kinase inhibitor. ErbB-2 is over-expressed in 25-30% of breast cancers and it has been associated with a high risk of relapse and death. Therefore, therapies targeted at erbB-2 have a great therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancers. ErbB-2 kinase inhibitors are capable of entering cell, blocking this extremely high tyrosine kinase activity and shutting-down the signal transduction pathway mediated by erbB-2 may be used as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of breast cancer. B-17 has little effect on the kinase activity of EGFR, displaying an excellent selectivity between Her-2 and EGFR. B-17 effectively inhibited tumor growth in multiple human breast cancer xenograft models with high Her-2 over-expression and have little effect on tumor growth in xenograft models with high level of EGFR but low level of Her-2.;" In discovery study, the computational structure-based database searching has led to the discovery of several classes of structurally novel, potent and selective non-peptide small-molecule inhibitors of erbB-2. Of which, B-17 has achieved sub-micromolar potency in inhibition of erbB-2 phosphorylation and cancer cell growth in human breast cancer cell lines with over-expression of erbB-2. The in vitro studies using isogenic model cell lines and diverse human breast cancer cell lines have clearly demonstrated the activity and selectivity of B-17 and provided in-depth insights into its molecular mechanism of action. The in vivo studies have shown that B17 was highly effective in inhibition of tumor growth in animal models of human breast cancer and provided insights into its mode of action. These data thus strongly suggested that B-17 represents a promising lead compound for further optimization and development as a new class of anticancer therapy for the treatment of human breast cancer with over-expression of erbB-2.; University of Michigan has filed a patent application no PCT/US01/23869, on July 2001, entitled ""ErbB-2 selective small molecule kinase inhibitors "".

The drug candidate is administered intravenously. BCX-3607 acts by targeting tissue factor/factor VIIa. The drug candidate has been developed by using structure-based drug design technology.;BCX-3607, TF/FVIIa inhibitor is an anti angina agent. Blood coagulation is a series of reactions in which plasma zymogens are converted into active enzymes. The final event of these reactions is the formation of insoluble fibrin clot. Tissue factor is an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein that is normally not exposed on the surface of intact blood vessels. When the vascular lumen is damaged, tissue factor is exposed and then binds to the small amounts of circulating factors VIIa and VII. This facilitates conversion of factor VII to factor VIIa. Factor VIIa bound to tissue factor in the presence of calcium and phospholipids facilitates the conversion of factor IX to factor IXa and factor X to factor Xa. The drug candidate shows therapeutic intervention by inhibiting the clotting cascade by antagonizing factor VIIa, which in turn inhibits the formation of clot and relieves angina.;" &lt;p&gt;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that they have terminated merger agreement with &lt;span id=""ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lblSummary""&gt;Idera Pharmaceuticals Inc. &lt;/span&gt;following the BioCryst stockholders&rsquo; failure to approve the adoption of the agreement at the BioCryst special stockholders meeting.&lt;/p&gt;; &lt;p&gt;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc announced that it is offering to sell USD 55 million of its common stock in an underwritten public offering.

It is administered via sub-dermal and intradermal injection. The drug candidate is a phospholipid gel (PG) incorporating buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a derivative of the opioid alkaloid thebaine which is a long lasting analgesic. Buprenorphine's analgesic effect is due to partial agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors. Buprenorphine is also a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. The partial agonist activity means that opioid receptor antagonists only partially reverse the effects of buprenorphine. The binding to the mu and kappa receptors results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. It is developed based on phospholipid gel (PG) drug delivery technology.;Buprenorphine hydrochloride ER (ETI-311) acts as a partial agonist at mu and as an antagonist at kappa receptor. Buprenorphine binds to and activates the mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). Thereby it mimics the effects of the endogenous opiates. Binding to opioid receptors, it stimulates exchange of GTP for GDP, inhibits adenylate cyclase and decreases intracellular cAMP. This inhibits the release of various nociceptive neurotransmitters, such as substance P, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, vasopressin, and somatostatin. In addition, buprenorphine closes N-type voltage-gated calcium channels and opens calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels. It results in hyperpolarization, reduced neuronal excitability, analgesia and sedation. The binding to the mu and kappa receptors results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. Thus, the drug candidate could play an effective role in the treatment of pain.;" Encore Therapeutics Inc. was developing buprenorphine hydrochloride ER (ETI-311) for the treatment of post-operative, cancer and other subacute pain relief and the treatment of opium withdrawal syndrome. As of May 2014, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development.; In June 2005, Therapeutics Inc Encore filed a patent with application number (EP20050771368) entitled “Phospholipid compositions and methods for their preparation and use”. The present invention related to compositions that comprise a phospholipid component (that contains one or more phospholipids) and a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid carrier, where the phospholipid component is in the range from about 10% to about 90% of the total weight.; The pre-clinical study of buprenorphine showed that the drug produced clinically relevant plasma levels of the drug over 3-7 days when administered by intradermal injection in dog studies. These results add to the growing number of applications for ETI's drug delivery platform technology to deliver drugs both locally and systemically in a high-load and continuous manner. This study demonstrates that the ETI-311 achieved stable and clinically relevant blood levels of buprenorphine, and further validates our growing portfolio of PG-based product candidates that can provide shortened development cycle proprietary products.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;19-May-2014;;;;

Pronounced anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in lung fibrosis in vivo model, reduction of IOP (intraocular pressure) in rabbit after trabeculectomy over 28 days and prolongs bleb survival compared to vehicle and it also blocked abnormal blood vessels growth in the eye in CNV (choroidal neovascularization), ROP (retinopathy of prematurity) in zebra fish models. CLT-28643 was evaluated in rabbit trabeculectomy model. CLT-28643 was given as a single subconjunctival injection intraoperatively to two of the right eye groups followed by postoperative vehicle eye drops or CLT-28643 eye drops 4 times daily. A group received mitomycin-C (MMC) intraoperatively followed by vehicle eye drops postoperatively. Results showed CLT-28643 significantly prolonged bleb survival, and better bleb score compared to the control-surgery group. At end of the study, most functioning blebs were found in the MMC group. CLT-28643 was non-toxic and well tolerated and seems inferior to MMC.Researchers reported that the efficacy of CLT-28643 on surgical outcome was determined in a mouse model for filtering surgery (n = 40 eyes from 20 mice per group). Single and repeated subconjunctival (SCJ) injections (1 or 2 µg) and topical eye drops (10 µg) of the integrin inhibitor were compared with 2-minute administration of mitomycin C (MMC) 0.02%. Bleb size, survival, and signs of toxicity were examined until 28 days after surgery. Immunostaining showed that integrin alpha 5 beta 1 was highly expressed in the bleb at early time-points after surgery and that CLT-28643 dose-dependently inhibited this upregulation for bleb area and survival, and the wound healing process. While 2-µg single injection of CLT-28643 improved bleb characteristics in a similar way as 10-µg administered by eye drops and MMC, repeated injections of 2 µg showed superior efficacy compared to MMC, with no corneal toxicity.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;15-Jun-2015;;;;

Camptothecin (CPT) acts by targeting DNA Topoisomerase I.;Cyt-Topo is a cytotoxic anti-cancer agent. Cyt-Topo comprises camptothecin. Camptothecin is a cytotoxic pentacyclic alkaloid. Camptothecins selectively target topoisomerase I (Top1) by trapping the catalytic intermediate of the Top1-DNA reaction, the cleavage complex. Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), a ubiquitous enzyme involved in the regulation of DNA topology during replication, recombination and transcription. TOP1 forms a phosphotyrosine bond with DNA, catalyzing a forward reaction in which DNA is cleaved to allow unwinding, and a reverse reaction in which DNA is religated.

HepG2 cells expressing HBV replicons was treated for 72 hours in the presence or absence of FGI-104, with vehicle treated samples providing a negative control. FGI-104 inhibited HBV infection of HepG2 cells and in a dose-dependent manner, with an estimated EC50 of 20 nM. Huh7 cells were infected with luciferase expressing HCV JFH-1 virus for 72 hours in the presence of absence of FGI-104. Luciferase-based readouts of viral release into the culture supernatant demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of HCV replication by FGI-104.

It is developed based on synthetic   peptide chemistry technology.;MAR531 is a glucagon analog that can provide enhanced physical chemical properties that would enable it to be kept in solution form at room temperature for an extended period of time. When blood glucose begins to fall, glucagon another hormone made by the pancreas signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. Blood glucose will then rise toward a normal level. The glucagon response to hypoglycemia is impaired and other hormones such as epinephrine, also called adrenaline, may raise the blood glucose level. Glucagon increases the amount of glucose in the blood by breaking down stored glucose (starch, called glycogen) and releasing it from the liver into the bloodstream. Glucagon secretion increases rapidly in response to hypoglycemia.;" In December 2010, RHI Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Marcadia Biotech, Inc., (‘Marcadia’). The acquisition of Marcadia will allow the RHI Group to integrateMarcadia’s development pipeline into its own Research and Development portfolio.The total purchase consideration was USD 377 million, of which $287 million was paid in cash and $90 million arises from a contingent consideration arrangement.In June 2010, Marcadia and Eli Lilly and Company signed a development and exclusive license agreement for the short-acting glucagon program.

As of May 2014, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development. Company was planned to file through 505 b(2) regulatory pathway.; In June 2005, Therapeutics Inc Encore filed a patent with application number (EP20050771368) entitled “Phospholipid compositions and methods for their preparation and use”. The present invention related to compositions that comprise a phospholipid component (that contains one or more phospholipids) and a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid carrier, where the phospholipid component is in the range from about 10% to about 90% of the total weight.; In October 2011, Encore Therapeutics Inc. (ETI) announced that it successfully completed a pre-clinical Proof of Concept (POC) study on ETI-511, its proprietary, extended release phospholipid gel (PG) depot formulation of the NSAID drug meloxicam. The company is developing ETI-511 as a long-acting local therapy for pain and inflammation. The key findings from the POC study are: (a) ETI-511 provided about 100-fold higher local tissue levels of meloxicam for at least 48 hours around the injection site compared to orally dosed meloxicam. (b) ETI-511 exhibited lower plasma meloxicam levels at all times compared to the oral dosing and (c) ETI-511 was well tolerated locally and systemically following subcutaneous injections. ETI-511 therefore provides sustained, localized delivery of much higher levels of meloxicam than is possible with oral dosing thereby providing the potential for both enhanced and prolonged efficacy with reduced systemic side effects. Along with its excellent stability data, ETI-511 generates a compelling commercial rationale for a new NSAID treatment modality for a variety of pain and inflammatory disorders.In April 2011, Encore Therapeutics Inc. (ETI) has developed a proprietary extended release subcutaneous (SC) depot formulation (ETI-511) of the NSAID drug meloxicam.

NSAID delivers to the therapeutic target with minimal blood levels and blocks the enzymes that make prostaglandins. As a result, inflammation and its accompanying symptoms are reduced. The drug candidate may checks the progression of the disease by limiting the inflammatory response. It is developed based on phospholipid gel (PG) drug delivery technology.;Meloxicam ER (ETI-511) works by inhibiting COX-2. It acts as an anti inflammatory agent with analgesic property. COX-2 act as a catalyzing agent in the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation and pain. The NSAIDs work by affecting chemicals in the body which cause inflammation. They interfere with the production of prostaglandins that promote inflammation, pain, and fever. NSAIDs inhibit the generation of prostaglandins by blocking cyclooxygenase enzymes. The drug candidate exhibit therapeutic intervention in the treatment of the disease by checking the underlying cause.;" Encore Therapeutics Inc., was developing meloxicam (ETI-511) for the treatment of pain and inflammation. As of May 2014, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development. Company was planned to file through 505 b(2) regulatory pathway.; In June 2005, Therapeutics Inc Encore filed a patent with application number (EP20050771368) entitled “Phospholipid compositions and methods for their preparation and use”. The present invention related to compositions that comprise a phospholipid component (that contains one or more phospholipids) and a pharmaceutically acceptable fluid carrier, where the phospholipid component is in the range from about 10% to about 90% of the total weight.; In October 2011, Encore Therapeutics Inc. (ETI) announced that it successfully completed a pre-clinical Proof of Concept (POC) study on ETI-511, its proprietary, extended release phospholipid gel (PG) depot formulation of the NSAID drug meloxicam. The company is developing ETI-511 as a long-acting local therapy for pain and inflammation. The key findings from the POC study are: (a) ETI-511 provided about 100-fold higher local tissue levels of meloxicam for at least 48 hours around the injection site compared to orally dosed meloxicam. (b) ETI-511 exhibited lower plasma meloxicam levels at all times compared to the oral dosing and (c) ETI-511 was well tolerated locally and systemically following subcutaneous injections. ETI-511 therefore provides sustained, localized delivery of much higher levels of meloxicam than is possible with oral dosing thereby providing the potential for both enhanced and prolonged efficacy with reduced systemic side effects. Along with its excellent stability data, ETI-511 generates a compelling commercial rationale for a new NSAID treatment modality for a variety of pain and inflammatory disorders.In April 2011, Encore Therapeutics Inc. (ETI) has developed a proprietary extended release subcutaneous (SC) depot formulation (ETI-511) of the NSAID drug meloxicam. ETI-511 enables delivery of high concentrations of meloxicam to a localized area over an extended period of time and therefore provides a potential variety of new therapeutic applications for pain and inflammation.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;19-May-2014;;;NDA-505(b)(2);

The drug candidate is administered through subcutaneous route. The drug candidate is a inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor. iNOS is a dual-action molecule incorporating neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) with macrophages inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by three isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) found in endothelial cells (eNOS), neuronal cells (nNOS) and macrophages (iNOS), and this family of enzymes serves different functions.;The drug candidate is an inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos or type II nos) inhibitor. Inducible NOS (iNOS) is produced as an offshoot of the inflammatory response, by TNF and other cytokines. It results in massive production of nitric oxide, causing widespread vasodilatation (due to loss of vasomotor tone) and hypotension, which is hyporeactive to adrenergic agents. Nitric oxide results vasodilation in sepsis, mediated by ATP-sensitive potassium channels in smooth muscle. Thus by inhibiting the inducible nitric oxide synthase the drug candidate inhibits the production of nitric oxide and the vasodilation and other inflammatory reactions which are produced by nitric oxide via ATP-sensitive potassium channels and various cytokines.;" In 2005 Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported a comparison of effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors on plasma nitrite/nitrate levels and tissue NOS activity in septic organs. The rats treated with the three iNOS inhibitors (N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W),(1 S, 5 S, 6 R, 7 R )-2-aza-7-chloro-3-imino-5-methylbicyclo [4.1.0] heptane hydrochloride (ONO-1714), and aminoguanidine) administered 1 hr after LPS injection, showed dose-dependent decreases in plasma NOx levels and NOS activity in the lungs. The non-selective NOS inhibitor (N(G)-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)) had an effect only at the maximum dose. The differences in in vitro iNOS selectivity among these drugs did not correlate with iNOS selectivity at the tissue level. The relationship between plasma NOx levels and NOS activity in the lungs showed a linear relationship with or without the NOS inhibitors. In conclusion, the iNOS selectivity of these drugs does not seem to differ at the tissue level. Plasma NOx levels may be a useful indicator of lung NOS activity. In August 2000 Fukuoka University reported a study for evaluating the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase using a novel and selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor in septic lung injury produced by cecal ligation and puncture. All rats that received CLP died within 48 h after the intervention. The subcutaneous injection of ONO-1714 at 0.03 mg/kg every 12 h resulted in a significantly longer survival time than the saline control only when administration was started 12 h after the CLP procedure. The other administration schedules, which started immediately or 6 h after the intervention, did not show any improvement in the survival rates in comparison with the saline control. The administration of ONO-1714 at higher (0.1 mg/ kg) or lower (0.01 mg/kg) doses when given anytime after the intervention did not improve the survival rates. The NO(x) (NO(2)(-) + NO(3)(-)) levels in the plasma significantly increased 12 h after intervention in comparison with NO(x) at 0 h and thereafter further increased in parallel with the time elapsed. The CLP rats that were initially treated with ONO-1714 (0.03 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 h) 12 h after intervention showed significantly reduced NO(x) levels in the plasma in comparison with the saline control. The NO synthase activity in lung homogenates increased from 6 to 24 h after the CLP and thereafter decreased to 42 h. The administration of ONO-1714 inhibited iNOS activity (under calcium-free conditions) in preference to total iNOS activity (under calcium-dependent conditions) in lung homogenates, which thus suggested that this compound selectively inhibited iNOS in lung tissue. The iNOS protein expression in the lung and liver homogenates showed a similar time course with alterations of NOS activity, namely a maximum level at 24 h after the intervention followed by decreasing levels to 42 h. On the other hand, other isozymes of NOS, eNOS, and nNOS in lung homogenates, were constantly expressed over the time course after the CLP. Since the iNOS mRNA expression in lung homogenates continued to elevate until 42 h, the decrease in iNOS activity and protein expression later than 24 h after the CLP was thus considered to be due to some posttranscriptional mechanism during the late phase of sepsis. In conclusion, intervention with a potent and selective iNOS inhibitor seemed to improve survival in CLP rats when used at the appropriate doses and time points. However, the self-limited mechanism of iNOS regulation in the lungs may also indicate that iNOS plays only a limited role in sepsis and septic shock.; In February 2003, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. filed a patent application no (EP20030705265) titled “Fused pyridazine derivative compounds and drugs containing the compounds as the active ingredient”.

Six treatments were administrated i.v. on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 after protocol starting time. To compare the safety of SP1010C and Taxol, the subacute toxicity study was performed in rats. Histamine release detection was performed with the plasma of the rats that received the treatments with the MTD doses of both formulations. The results showed that the treatment with 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg doses of SP1010C significantly inhibited (by 80 to 99%) MCF-7 tumor growth compared to control. At the doses of 40 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, the inhibitory effect of SP1010C on tumor growth was comparable to that observed with Taxol treatment at a dose of 20 mg/kg. A comparable inhibitory effect on MCF-7 ADR tumors was found after the treatments with 20 mg/kg Taxol and 40 mg/kg SP1010C. Treatment with a 60 mg/kg dose of SP1010C induced greater inhibition of MCF-7 ADR tumor growth compared to that achieved using 20 mg/kg Taxol. The MTD for SP1010C was 45 mg/kg/injection while that for Taxol was 5 mg//kg/injection under the same experimental conditions.Moreover, contrary to Taxol, SP1010C did not induce significant histamine release; Supratek Pharma Inc. was engaged in the development of paclitaxel (SP-1010C) for the treatment of breast cancer.

PL-4500 targets the enzyme cyclooxygenase I and II necessary for the formation of prostaglandins and other autacoids. The drug candidate is based on the PlxGuard technology in which the NSAID is pre-associated with phosphatidylcholine.;The drug candidate inhibits cylooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which leads to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The drug candidate works by stimulating the muscles inside the PDA to constrict, thereby closing the connection. Indomethacin blocks the enzymes that make prostaglandins (cyclooxygenase 1 and 2) and thereby reduce the levels of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals that the body produces to cause fever and pain that are associated with inflammation. The NSAID-PC pre-association effectively sequesters the NSAID in a phospholipid envelope, allowing the NSAID to reach the blood stream without disrupting the GI lining. The drug candidate may exhibit therapeutic intervention by checking the progression of disease and limiting the gastrointestinal side effects associated with NSAID.;" &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=""ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lblSummary""&gt;PLx Pharma Inc., raised USD 3.11 million in a venture financing round.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;; During 2010 to 2013, Plx Pharma Inc. was awarded research grant of USD 157,934, USD 565,449, USD 552,949 from Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Of Child Health & Human Development (1R43HD061132-01A1, 2R44HD061132-02, 5R44HD061132-03) for the project entitled ""GI-Safer Formulation Of Indomethacin For Use In Preterm Neonates"".; PLx Pharma Inc. reported that it merged with Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in an all-stock transaction.

RTA 502 is a bisimidazoacridone derivative.  RTA 502 (HKH40A) is an optimized 8-methoxy analog of the unsymmetrical bifunctional antitumor agent WMC79.;RTA 502 (HKH40A) kills tumor cells by up-regulation of the apoptotic cascade. It inhibits topoisomerase I and also inactivates the kinases, PI3K and AKT. It down regulates ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2). RNR controls dNTP pools and the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc7 that regulates entry into S-phase of the cell cycle by maintaining the integrity of replication forks. As this DNA repair protein has been demonstrated to be a key mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine, RTA 502 may prove highly effective when used in combination with gemcitabine. HKH40A also activates ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase leading to cell cycle block at G2/M phase of cell division. By inhibiting topoisomerase I enzyme it interferes with the replication of DNA and consequently, the cell division is arrested.;" &lt;p&gt;&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt; &lt;w:WordDocument&gt;  &lt;w:View&gt;Normal&lt;/w:View&gt;

The drug candidate is administered by parenteral route. It is a stable liquid small volume injection (27-30 G needle) administered with autoinjector. The drug candidate is based on a half-life extension recombinant PEGylation (rPEG) technology called XTEN technology.;VRS-808 is an extended half-life glucagon construct that contains a long unstructured tail of hydrophilic amino acids. Glucagon binds to the glucagon receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, located in the plasma membrane. The conformation change in the receptor activates G proteins and when the G protein interacts with the receptor, it undergoes a conformational change that results in the replacement of the GDP molecule that was bound to the alpha subunit with a GTP molecule. A glucagon construct that enables a single dose to maintain basal glucose levels during sleep while minimizing the chance for long term changes in hemoglobin A1c may preventing hypoglycemia and exhibit therapeutic intervention by checking the disease progression.    ;" &lt;p&gt;Aravive, Inc announced the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 3,333,334 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of USD 7.50 per share.&nbsp; Aravive expects to receive gross proceeds of approximately USD 25 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by Aravive.

The proposed merger will result in a combined publicly traded, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company operating under a new name, Larimar Therapeutics, Inc. The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders of Chondrial will receive shares of newly issued Zafgen common shares in a private placement. Chondrial stockholders are expected to own approximately 60 percent of the combined company and current Zafgen stockholders will own approximately 40 percent of the combined company. The percentage of the combined company that Chondrial&rsquo;s stockholders will own as of the close of the transaction is subject to adjustment based on the amount of Zafgen&rsquo;s net cash at the closing date, among other adjustments as described in the merger agreement. Upon closing of the transaction, Zafgen will be renamed Larimar Therapeutics, Inc. and will be headquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Carole Ben-Maimon will serve as president and CEO of the combined company. The agreement provides that the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of Peter Barrett, Carole Ben-Maimon, Thomas Daniel, Thomas Hamilton, Jonathan Leff, Frank Thomas, and one designee of Deerfield Management. This transaction will create a clinical-stage company focused on the development of protein replacement therapies for rare diseases. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2020, subject to approvals by stockholders of each company and other customary closing conditions. The merger agreement provides each of Zafgen and Chondrial with specified termination rights, and further provides that, upon termination of the agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of USD3.38 million. In addition, in connection with certain terminations of the agreement, either party may be required to pay the other party&rsquo;s third party expenses up to USD0.35 million.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;; &lt;p&gt;Zafgen, Inc. has filed a prospectus and entered into sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC for public offering of securities, to raise aggregate gross proceeds of USD50 million. Zafgen intends to use the proceeds to advance the clinical development of ZGN-1258 for rare metabolic indications, initially focusing on PWS; develop clinical and nonclinical data necessary to potentially optimize the value of ZGN-1061, including unique mechanistic effects in diabetes, potential liver effects in NASH, and other endpoint data based upon proprietary knowledge of the MetAP2 pathway; advance ZGN-1345 into clinical development as an orally active MetAP2 inhibitor for the treatment of liver-specific metabolic disease; and fund working capital and other general corporate purposes.&lt;/p&gt;; Preclinical studies reported that ZGN-1258 showed robust weight loss and reduced food intake, rapid clearance in DIO mouse model.; Zafgen announced its decision to suspend plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application for ZGN-1258, the Company’s candidate for rare metabolic disorders including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), based on a, unexpected finding in muscle tissue in four- and six-month long-term rodent toxicology studies. Nonclinical data showed degeneration and other anomalies in rat muscle tissue to different degrees in both vehicle and dose arms of the studies. The effects were absent from other animal species in long term models, and importantly, this finding has not been observed in any of the Company’s other MetAP2 inhibitors or clinical trials and appears to be specific to ZGN-1258. Zafgen will provide an update on plans for ZGN-1258 at a later time, if warranted, following further evaluation.; Zafgen Inc announced results from three nonclinical, Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies of ZGN-1258 to be presented at the 2018 Foundation for Prader-Willi Research (FPWR) Family Conference taking place in Las Vegas October 4-6, 2018. The data being presented include “ZGN-1258 effects on body weight and food intake of hyperphagia and obesity”, “ZGN-1258 effects on other behavioral manifestations commonly observed in PWS, such as low physical activity, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behaviours” and “ZGN-1258 differentiation on nonclinical safety measures”. In one poster, the effects of ZGN-1258 are characterized in mouse models of hyperphagia and obesity: mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, and mice with hypothalamic injury associated (via gold thioglucose (GTG)) obesity. All three models have elements of hyperphagia in disease presentation, and the GTG and ob/ob models represent impaired hypothalamic function as a contributor to hyperphagia, which may translate to hypothalamic dysregulation seen in PWS. ZGN-1258 administered daily produced a dose-dependent reduction in intake of the high-fat diet and body weight in DIO mice; dose-dependent reduction in food intake and weight and normalization of the hyperphagic phenotype in ob/ob mice; and reduced food intake and weight in mice with GTG-induced obesity. Across the models and doses, the vast majority of endpoints were highly statistically significant. In a second poster, in three mouse models that share features with PWS, ZGN-1258 demonstrates improvement in behavioral manifestations commonly observed in PWS, including low physical activity, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. ZGN-1258 treatment produced statistically significant, robust weight loss in obese, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, and a smaller but statistically significant reduction in body weight in normal weight Magel2-null mice, which have a chromosome 15 mutation similar to PWS, as well as in normal weight FMR1 knockout (KO) mice, with characteristics of anxiety and compulsive behaviors. Measurements of anxiety-like behavior were reduced in all three mouse models. Most interestingly, ZGN-1258 treatment produced an observable, significant, dose-dependent improvement in locomotor activity in all mouse models. A third poster shows a comparison of the effects of ZGN-1258 and Zafgen’s first generation MetAP2 inhibitor on safety measures, including measures of thrombotic risk, demonstrating a highly differentiated profile for ZGN-1258 on endothelial cell effects. In toxicology models, ZGN-1258 doses approximately 100-fold greater than the projected clinical exposure had only a mild and transient effect on D-dimer and platelets, demonstrating a significantly improved safety profile and none of the prolonged endothelial cell effects associated with cardiovascular safety risk seen with the prior compound. Zafgen will also present the study design for PATH for PWS, a natural history study co-sponsored by FPWR and Zafgen that is intended to help better understand serious medical events in PWS in at least 500 patients over a 4-year period, as well as evaluate how PWS related behaviors change over time. The data from this study will inform the development and clinical trial design of potential new treatments for PWS, including ZGN-1258.; Zafgen Inc was developing ZGN-1258 for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome.
