As of April 2008, it was in preclinical stage for osteoporosis and female contraception.; Addex Therapeutics announced the publication of new scientific findings that help unravel the mode of action of dual follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin hormone receptor (LH/CGR) negative allosteric modulators (NAM). The results show that ADX68693, being NAM of FSHR, also strongly antagonizes LH/CGR signaling in murine Leydig tumor cell line (mLTC-1) and in rat primary Leydig cells. The physiological effects of FSH and LH on the ovary are characterized by the stimulation of the production of estradiol and progesterone. Company reported that a significant inhibition of testosterone production by ADX68693 was observed in both cell types, whereas progesterone production was only inhibited by ADX68693 in rat primary Leydig cells. In addition, ADX68693 totally abolished testosterone production, suggesting differential effects of the two NAMs on LH/CGR dependent pathways controlling steroidogenesis. The Company reported that this new finding, published in Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology by the group University of Tours, show their effect on the LH/CGR and their differential effect on intracellular signalling. Addex reported that, taken together, ADX68693 was identified as biased NAM at the LH/CGR in addition to the FSHR.; In March 2008, Addex Therapeutics Ltd filed a patent with application number (PCT/IB2008/000985) entitled “Novel benzamide derivatives as modulators of the follicle stimulating hormone "".

The drug candidate is a manganoporphyrin that contains a positively-charged manganese metal ion that is able to accept and give electrons to and from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).;AEOL-11207 is a synthetic catalytic antioxidant that mimic the body’s own antioxidant defensive enzymes i.e. superoxide dismutases and catalase. Oxygen not only plays a pivotal role in supporting life but also generates different forms of oxygen that can react harmfully with living organisms like superoxide, a free radical species that gives rise to hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, peroxynitrite and various other oxidants. These radicals damage deoxy ribonucleic acid, proteins and lipids resulting in inflammation and both acute and delayed cell death. Catalytic antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase repeatedly inactivate reactive oxygen molecules, which result in multiple reactive oxygen molecules combining with each antioxidant molecule.;" Aeolus Pharmaceuticals (Formerly Incara Pharmaceuticals Corporation) was developing AEOL-11207 for the treatment of epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. As of April 2016, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development. AEOL-11207 development program is being funded, in part, by private foundations, including the Michael J. Fox Foundation and Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE) and government grants.; Aeolus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the publication of data on AEOL 11207 in epilepsy in journal of Neurobiology of Disease.

AEOL11207 treated Sod2 -/- mice showed a decrease in the average number and duration of spontaneous behavioral seizures based on daily observation from 17 to 20 days old compare to vehicle treated Sod2 -/- mice. Only 60% of AEOL 11207-treated Sod2 -/- mice exhibited spontaneous seizure activity compared to 100% of vehicle-treated Sod2 -/- mice. Seizures from AEOL11207- treated Sod2 -/- mice occurred less frequently and had shorter duration as compared to vehicle-treated Sod2 -/- mice. Furthermore, the continuous seizure event those last longer than 60 s was not observed in AEOL 11207 treated Sod2 -/- mice.

During the course of in vivo pharmacokinetic experiments and mouse xenograft anti-tumor studies, the oral bioavailability in mice was determined to be about 60%, leading to micromolar plasma levels which are well above the nanomolar IC50 values in in vitro studies. Significant anti-tumor activity was observed at 30mg/kg daily oral administration in Hct116 and A549 models.

AEZS 126 showed good anti-tumor activity in in vitro models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as well as in MCF-7 cells. Main mechanism of cytotoxicity seems to be programmed cell death after an incubation time of 72 h, which could be abrogated by co-incubation with z-VAD-fmk in MCF-7 and MDA-MB468 cells. In HCC1806 cells, addition of necrostatin-1 has only slightly protective effects, but in HCC1937 cells, the addition of necrostatin-1 has the same protective effect as co-incubation with z-VAD-fmk, and this observation argues for cell death caused by apoptosis and necroptosis in this cell line.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;26-Feb-2013;;Targeted Therapy;;

AG-045572 was an Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (receptor blockers) are a class of compounds that are similar in structure to natural GnRH (a hormone made by neurons in the hypothalamus) but that have an antagonistic effect. GnRH antagonists are peptide molecules that are made up multiple, often synthetically produced amino acids. GnRH antagonists compete with natural GnRH for binding to GnRH receptors, thus decreasing or blocking GnRH action in the body. AG-045572 is administered orally.;The drug candidate AG-045572 (CMPD1) targets gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonists have potential in treating numerous hormone-dependent pathologies including cancers of the prostate, breast, and ovary, endometriosis, and fertility disorders. GnRH antagonists are used to provide fast suppression of testosterone without the surge in testosterone levels that is seen when treating patients with GnRH agonists. GnRH activates nucleus factor kappaB (NFkappaB) and protects the cancer cells from apoptosis in ovarian cancer and breast cancer. GnRH antagonists induces apoptosis and plays an effective role in treatment of ovarian cancer and breast cancer.;" AG-045572 (CMPD1) was under development by Agouron Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Pfizer) for the treatment of prostate, breast, ovary, endometriosis, and fertility disorders. As of June 2003, it was in the pre-clinical stage of development. The development of AG-045572 (CMPD1) was suspended.; Allergan plc announced that its merger agreement with Pfizer has been terminated by mutual agreement. In connection with the termination of the merger agreement, Pfizer has agreed to pay Allergan, USD 150 million for reimbursement of expenses associated with the transaction.; The GnRH antagonist CMPD1 was a compound developed for oral bioavailability that, when administered to intact male rats at a single dose of 100 mg/kg, maintained suppression of testosterone in the castrate range for 24 hours. Pfizer conducted a study of biological characterization of a novel, orally active small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist using castrated and intact rats. An unmet clinical need exists for an orally available GnRH receptor antagonist. Guided by structure-activity relationships, ligand-based targeted library designs, and biomarker measurements, researchers discovery efforts had yielded a novel, small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist, 5-[(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)methyl]-N-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-furamide (CMPD1). CMPD1 bound with low nanomolar affinities to human, rat, and mouse GnRH receptors (6.0, 3.8, and 2.2 nM, respectively). CMPD1 was more than 100-fold selective for GnRH receptors versus various G-protein-coupled receptors and other enzymes and ion channels. In cells expressing recombinant rat GnRH receptors, CMPD1 was a competitive antagonist of GnRH-stimulated increases in extracellular acidification rates in Cytosensor microphysiometer assays. In cells expressing recombinant human GnRH receptors, CMPD1 was a potent inhibitor of GnRH-stimulated total inositol phosphate accumulation. The effects of CMPD1 on circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were studied in castrated and intact male rats, respectively. Intravenous and oral administration of CMPD1 dose dependently suppressed GnRH-mediated elevations of LH in castrated male rats and testosterone in gonad-intact male rats. Moreover, CMPD1, when given at 20 mg/kg i.v. to intact male rats, inhibited the elevations of LH and testosterone stimulated by the superagonist of GnRH, [d-Ala(6), des-Gly(10)]GnRH (GnRH-A). These data suggest that CMPD1 is a potent, selective, orally active GnRH receptor antagonist that may have potential application as a therapeutic agent for treating hormone-dependent cancers and diseases. Pfizer conducted a study of effect of testosterone suppression on the pharmacokinetics of a potent gnRH receptor antagonist. In this study enzyme kinetic parameters were obtained by incubating AG-045572 (0.1-30 microM) with human or rat liver microsomes, or expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The pharmacokinetics of AG-045572 (10 mg/kg i.v. or 20 mg/kg p.o.) were studied in intact male, female, castrated male and male rats pretreated with AG-045572 for 4 days. AG-045572 was metabolized by CYP3A in both rats and humans. The Km values were similar in male and female human, female rat liver microsomes, and expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (0.39, 0.27, 0.28, 0.25, and 0.26 microM, respectively). The Km in male rat liver microsomes was 1.5 microM, suggesting that in male and female rats AG-045572 is metabolized by different CYP3A isozymes. The oral bioavailability of AG-045572 in intact male rats was 8%, while in female or castrated male rats it was 24%. Pretreatment of intact male rats with AG-045572 i.m. for 4 days resulted in suppression of testosterone to castrate levels, accompanied by an increase in oral bioavailability of AG-045572 to 27%. In the same experiment, the male-specific pulsatile pattern of growth hormone remained unchanged with slightly elevated baseline levels. From the above results it was concluded that the potent GnRH receptor antagonist AG-045572 was metabolized by hormone-dependent CYP3A. As a result, suppression of testosterone by pretreatment with AG-045572 feminized its own pharmacokinetics.	";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;30-Jun-2003;;Targeted Therapy;;Ovarian Cancer

As of December 2013, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; In December 2013, the company reported that IDH1 mutant inhibitor induceed cellular differentiation and offered a combination benefit with Ara-C in a primary human IDH1 mutant AML xenograft model. The scientists reported that they treated a primary human IDH1 (R132H)/FLT3-ITD mutant xenograft model with AGI-14100 either alone or in combination with Ara-c.  In these studies, AGI-14100 alone significantly decreased tumor burden in the peripheral blood after 1 month of continuous BID treatment. In combination with a short-term, low-dose course of Ara-C, they also observed a decrease in the bone marrow tumor burden that was better than either treatment alone. In addition they reported that this response was sustainable for more than 3 weeks.  In conclusion, the company reported that inhibition of mutant IDH1 with AGI-14100 and low dose Ara-c could provide a combination benefit for patients with AML.; In May 2016, Agios Pharmaceuticals and Celgene Corporation agreed to terminate the 2010 Agreement, effective as of August 15, 2016, as to the program directed to the IDH1 target, for which ivosidenib (AG-120) is the lead development candidate. Under the 2010 Agreement, Celgene had held development and commercialization rights to the IDH1 program outside of the United States, and we held such rights inside the United States. As a result of the termination, Agios Pharmaceuticals obtained global rights to ivosidenib (AG-120) and the IDH1 program.In December 2013, Agios Pharmaceuticals reported an extension of one additional year to the period of exclusivity for strategic cancer metabolism collaboration with Celgene Corporation. As a result of the extension, Celgene would maintain its exclusive option to all drug candidates emerging from Agios cancer metabolism research platform through April 2015. Under the terms of the agreement, Agios would receive a 20 million dollars payment. Celgene could extend this collaboration period for one additional year for an additional payment.In March 2013, Agios entered into a multi-year diagnostic partnership with Foundation Medicine for Agios’ lead programs in cancer metabolism. These programs focused on developing new cancer metabolism inhibitors targeting tumors carrying mutations in either the IDH1 or IDH2 metabolic enzymes. Foundation Medicine and Agios were collaborating to identify tumor genomic alterations that could be used to identify which patients were most likely to respond to Agios’ IDH1 and IDH2 drug candidates, and to develop and potentially commercialize diagnostic products for these programs.In April 2010, Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc reported that the company entered into a global strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation focused on targeting cancer metabolism. The agreement was to discover, develop, and deliver disease-altering therapies in oncology based on the transformational science of Agios’ innovative cancer metabolism research platform. Agios received 130 million dollars upfront payment, including an equity investment that comprised the company’s Series B financing round. Agios would lead research and early development efforts through Phase I, while Celgene would receive an option to obtain exclusive rights either upon IND acceptance or at the end of Phase I, to further develop and commercialize drugs emerging from Agios’ cancer metabolism research. Celgene would lead and fund global development and commercialization of some of these drugs, and Agios would retain development and commercialization rights for certain drugs in the United States.

E2F also directs the synthesis of both cyclin E and cdk2, creating the kinase activity responsible for activation of replication. Cyclin E/cdk2 also functions to further the process of Rb inactivation that is initiated by D/cdk4 action. Thus, virtually the entire process involved in the activation of DNA replication and the regulation of the G1/S transition is under the control of the Rb/E2F pathway. Rb/E2F pathway controlls cell growth. As the drug candidate was targeted against E2F, it might be helpful in treating cancer.;" &lt;p&gt;Merck and ArQule, Inc announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire ArQule for USD 20 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of USD 2.7 billion.

ARX828 is administered orally. ARX828 targets iNOS (Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase). ARX828 is a small molecule with potent anti- inflammatory and immuno-modulation activity.;ARX828 is an iNOS (Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase) inhibitor. It is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD refers to two chronic diseases that cause inflammation of the intestines such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. High levels of nitric oxide (NO) produced from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a consistent observation in IBD. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints. RA can also cause inflammation of the tissue around the joints, as well as in other organs in the body. NO has been implicated as a mediator of inflammatory arthritis.

As of January 2015, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; In June 2011, Astellas Pharma initiated the investigation of the pharmacology of a phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitor, ASP3258 comparing its potency with that of the most advanced PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast and cilomilast. PDE4 inhibition by ASP3258 was as potent as that achieved with roflumilast. ASP3258 inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a production in rat whole blood cells and rat alveolar macrophages. Orally administered ASP3258, roflumilast and cilomilast dose-dependently inhibited production of interleukin-4, TNF-a, and cysteinyl leukotrienes, as well as leukocyte infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the airways of ovalbumin-sensitized Brown Norway rats, and these compounds showed almost complete inhibition at doses of 3, 3, and 30 mg/kg, respectively. Orally administered roflumilast and cilomilast, but not ASP3258, inhibited a(2)-adrenoceptor agonist-induced anesthesia in rats and induced emesis in ferrets. Although ASP3258 inhibited airway inflammation completely, it had no emetic activity. The company investigated the effect of ASP3258 on cigarette smoke exposure-induced lung injury in guinea pigs, a well-defined model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Orally administered ASP3258 dose-dependently suppressed pulmonary accumulation of mononuclear cells and neutrophils, and the inhibitory effect of ASP3258 was almost the same as that of roflumilast. Histological examination revealed that ASP3258 treatment significantly inhibited infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into either or both alveolar or peribronchiolar areas, as well as hyperplastic and squamous metaplastic changes of epithelium in the bronchi. Decreasing trends in histological scores for accumulation of lymphocytes in the alveoli and alveolar wall thickening were also observed in ASP3258-treated animals. Further, ASP3258 attenuated augmentation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These findings suggest that ASP3258 has therapeutic potential for treating COPD not only through inhibition of pulmonary cellular accumulation but also by preventing lung structural alterations initiated by repeated cigarette smoke exposure.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;01-Jan-2015;;;;

New research data presented at the international conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics reveal that BAL27862 has impressive activity against a panel of non small cell lung cancer cell lines, including patient-derived tumor cells resistant to paclitaxel. A detailed analysis demonstrates a dominant effect of BAL27862 on microtubules that is clearly distinct from that seen with microtubule-targeting agents currently used in clinical practice. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that BAL27862 is efficiently distributed to tissues in a mouse model of human cancer, with excellent tumor as well as brain penetration. Potent activity was observed against glioblastoma cell lines associated with a dramatic increase in tumor cell death Pre-clinical data confirm that BAL27862 suppresses microtubule dynamics in living cancer cells. Furthermore, the distinct microtubule phenotype induced by BAL27862 is associated with an apparent severing of the microtubules leading to their fragmentation. The studies further demonstrate that BAL27862 has broad activity against a panel of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines resistant to currently marketed microtubule-targeted therapeutics. BAL27862 not only overcomes P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance, but also resistance related to modifications in the expression of proteins involved in tumor cell survival and microtubule function, respectively. The distinct microtubule phenotype and anticancer profile associated with BAL27862 supports evaluation in cancer patients with treatment-refractory tumors.

Lipoidalamine-injected rats were given daily oral doses of BF389 or the comparators for 21 days. BF389 was evaluated for effects on the acute inflammatory response in the carrageenan paw edema assay in rats, volumes of both hind paws were determined 3 hr later. Basal serum prostaglandin (PG) E2 levels and PGE2 levels in arachidonate-stimulated blood from these same animals also were measured. No anti-inflammatory activity was observed in BF389-treated rats despite the occurrence of profound suppression of basal and stimulated PGE2 production. Animals treated with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in this assay had both suppressed PGE2 production and significant anti-inflammatory activity. In another study, groups of rats were given p.o. doses of 1, 10, 100 or 250 mg/kg of BF389 for 5 days in order to determine peak concentrations, T1/2s and total areas under the plasma (tissue) drug concentration curves in plasma and paws. Peak plasma concentrations occurred 2 to 4 hr post dosing and the half-life was 8 to 15 hr over the 1- to 250-mg/kg/day dose range.

VEGFR-3 is involved in angiogenesis. The drug candidate interacts with cell surface kinase, VEGFR-3 and reduces blood flow to the melanoma tumor. By inhibiting VEGFR-3, genetic transcription involving cell proliferation and angiogenesis is inhibited.;" Bionomics Limited announced the presentation of data from BNC420, at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 106th Annual Meeting. The presentation entitled “BNC420 is a novel VEGFR3 selective inhibitor, which unlike the pan-VEGFR inhibitor Sunitinib, suppresses lymphatic metastasis in a model of metastatic melanoma,” demonstrated that BNC420 significantly outperforms first-line treatment sunitinib in inhibiting tumour metastasis. In a murine model of melanoma, BNC420 suppressed the development of tumour lymphatics, the growth of regional metastatic lesions and the spread of metastasis to the draining lymph nodes. In contrast, sunitinib failed to suppress lymph node metastasis and appeared to enhance formation of regional metastatic lesions.; Bionomics Ltd was developing BNC-420 for the treatment of solid tumors including metastatic melanoma and breast cancer. As of January 2017, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development.; In 2014, Bionomics Limited in collaboration with Cancer Therapeutics CRC announced the new drug candidate BNC-420 evoked from the VEGFR-3 program. In 2008, Bionomics enrolled itself as a founding member of the Cancer Therapeutics Cooperative Research Center, a consortium of leading Australian and international research institutes and commercial entities focused on cancer research.; In February 2015, Bionomics Ltd filed a patent application (PCT/AU2015/000089) entitled “Inhibitors”. The invention relates to 2, 4, 5-substituted pyrimidines that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3), also known as Fms related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4), processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical agents or compositions containing such compounds or a method of using the compound for the treatment of proliferative diseases, such as cancer.; Researchers reported that they investigated the activity of BNC420 and the pan-VEGFR inhibitor Sunitinib in the B16F10 murine melanoma model. While Sunitinib slowed the growth of the primary lesion, as expected, it did not inhibit the development of lymph node metastasis and appeared to enhance the development of in-transit satellite lesions by 38% compared to its corresponding vehicle control. In contrast, only 20% of animals treated with BNC420 exhibited in-transit lesions compared to 53% in the corresponding vehicle control. Furthermore, a 50% reduction in the number of metastasis to the draining lymph nodes was seen in BNC420 treated animals. Melanoma lesions in animals treated with BNC420 were devoid of peritumoral lymphatic vessels. These results demonstrate that selective inhibition of VEGFR3 utilizing the novel small molecule BNC420 effectively inhibits the development of both in-transit metastatic lesions and lymph node metastasis while being unencumbered by the pro-metastatic effects that can accompany VEGFR2 inhibition through the induction of tumor hypoxia.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;31-Jan-2017;;Targeted Therapy;;

The drug candidate is administered by orally. Bz-423 is a prototype for bioenergetics program. Bz-423 inhibits the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase.;Bz-423 is a F1F0-ATP synthase inhibitor. Bz-423 induced selective apoptosis of alloreactive donor T cells and reversed GVHD in several bone marrow transplantation models without affecting hematopoietic stem cell engraftment, immune reconstitution or normal resting lymphocytes. It bind to the oligomycin-sensitivity-conferring protein component of the mitochondrial F(0)F(1)-ATPase which modulates the enzyme leading to formation of superoxide by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Scavenging this reactive oxygen species blocks all subsequent components of the apoptotic cascade. Inhibiting the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase in respiring cells has two direct consequences one ATP concentration decreases and other mitochondria transition from active to resting respiration. Each of these responses affects a series of different physiologic processes. These conditions favor the production of O2, which can function as a signaling molecule initiating apoptosis.;" In January 2011, Lycera announced positive data from the University of Michigan demonstrating the role of bioenergetics in selectively inhibiting pathogenic lymphocytes while preserving and enhancing the normal immune system. The data show that bioenergetic and redox properties of alloreactive T cells differentiate them from other proliferating cells and can be exploited pharmacologically to arrest graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in mice. The researchers tested the potential of Bz-423 to halt the progress of established GVHD in two allogeneic bone marrow transplantation models. Treatment with Bz-423 significantly reduced GVHD clinical scores after one week and improved survival in mice compared to controls treated with vehicle. Similar improvement in survival was seen when treatment was continued for 10 weeks. In another aggressive model of GVHD using a fully allogeneic donor/recipient strain combination, Bz-423 treatment for seven weeks again significantly reduced all clinical and histological parameters of disease. Bz-423 did not impair immune reconstitution in either the thymus or spleen and all the mice treated with the drug showed complete donor bone marrow (BM) engraftment. Additionally, the compound’s favorable toxicity profile is consistent with other studies and with the normal bioenergetic and redox profile of rapidly proliferating BM cells (basal rates of oxygen consumption, normal levels of anti-oxidants and stable mitochondrial membrane potential).; Lycera Corp. was engaged in the development of Bz-423 for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

As of November 2014, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development for epilepsy, neuropathic pain, pain, seizures, neuroinflammation, depression and as a neuroprotective agent.; In May 2011, Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that C-10068 was found to have activity in pre-clinical models of epilepsy, neuroprotection and neuropathic pain. C-10068 is based on a molecule that was reported to have pre-clinical anti-convulsant efficacy, but was limited by poor metabolic stability resulting in low oral bioavailability. Applying its DCE Platform (deuterated chemical entity platform), Concert improved the compound’s metabolic stability by selective incorporation of deuterium. As a result, in a pre-clinical model, bioavailability was increased approximately three-fold following oral dosing of C-10068 compared to the non-deuterated molecule. The results of these studies showed the anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effects of C-10068 at a dose that did not induce adverse effects. C-10068 demonstrated anti-convulsant activity in models of both grand mal and partial seizures. In vitro neuroprotection tests showed that C-10068 inhibited hippocampal neurotoxicity induced by the modelC-10068 is also active in models of neuropathic pain. C-10068 was studied in pre-clinical and anti-convulsant models that are considered to be indicative of clinical efficacy. The results of these studies showed the anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effects of C-10068 at a dose that did not induce adverse effects. Importantly, C-10068 demonstrated anti-convulsant activity in models of both grand mal and partial seizures. In vitro neuroprotection tests showed that C-10068 inhibited hippocampal neurotoxicity induced by the model.In rat model of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) evaluated the effects of C-10068 on PBBI-induced nonconvulsive seizures (NCS), acute neuroinflammation, and neurofunctional outcomes. C-10068 treatment significantly attenuated astrocyte activation in seizure-free animals. C-10068 failed to improve PBBI-induced motor and cognitive functions with the dosing regimen used in this study. Overall, the results indicating that C-10068 exerts both potent antiseizure and antiinflammatory effects are promising and warrant further investigation.; The pre-clinical studies with C-10068 were conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) anti-convulsant screening program.

The drug candidate is administered through oral route. It acts by targeting CCR1 chemokine receptor. It is developed using a suite of proprietary technologies, known as the EnabaLink drug discovery engine.;CCX-634 is CCR1 chemokine receptor inhibitor. The CCR1 receptor is responsible for the inflammatory responses underlying autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The selective accumulation and activation of leukocytes in inflamed tissues contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The chemokines and their receptors, which belong to a family of seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are involved in the selective accumulation and activation of leukocytes in inflamed tissues, and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Chemokines play an important role in the infiltration, localization, retention of infiltrating leukocytes and generation of ectopic germinal centers in the inflamed synovium. Inhibitors directly targeting chemokines or their receptors provide a therapeutic strategy in RA.;" In March 2004, ChemoCentryx entered into a collaboration with Forest Laboratories, Inc.

As of November 2013, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; In the preclinical study it has been demonstrated that CXCR7 expression can directly control tumor growth in vivo. The data showed that CXCR7 regulates several important biological processes including cell survival and tumor development in vivo models. The company has developed highly potent and selective small molecule compounds for CXCR7. The compounds are designed to selectively target CXCR7 in an effort to halt cancer progression while minimizing detrimental effects, such as generalized immunosuppression or cytotoxicity. Preclinical studies support not only the anti-tumor efficacy of this drug but also an excellent safety profile, a reflection of its highly targeted and specific activity profile, which is fundamentally different from many other cytotoxic drugs in development or on the market.The therapeutic effects of CCX650 were assessed in the rat C6 GBM model. In the studies, rats received 18Gy whole brain irradiation 7 days post tumor cell inoculation, in combination with either oral CCX650 or vehicle. Post-irradiation survival time was significantly extended in rats receiving CCX650 relative to those that received irradiation plus vehicle. Median survival time post-irradiation was 12 days (CCX650 group; p &lt; 0.01) vs. 8 days (vehicle group).

The patent is composed of compounds that act as potent antagonists of the CCR1 receptor, and have in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity. The compounds are generally aryl piperazine derivatives and are useful in pharmaceutical compositions, methods for the treatment of CCR1-mediated diseases, and as controls in assays for the identification of competitive CCR1 antagonists.; The in-vitro studies confirmed that CCX-721 inhibited chemotaxis of human monocytic THP-1 cells toward the CCR1. When the experiment was conducted in the presence of 100% human serum which contains proteins, such as albumin that reversibly bind small molecules, CCX721 retained its potent inhibition of CCR1-mediated chemotaxis. CCX721 did not inhibit CCR5-mediated chemotaxis, even when CCX721 was present at a high concentration indicating greater than 106-fold selectivity for CCR1 relative to CCR5. CCX721 potently inhibited CCL3 binding and CCL3-induced calcium release in THP-1 cells. CCX721 retained its potency when tested using human blood monocytes, it fully inhibited the chemotaxis of these cells toward CCL3, even when the assay was conducted in 100% human serum. The potency of CCX721 toward human CCR1 was confirmed using [125I]-CCL15 saturation binding studies on freshly isolated human monocytes. CCX721 was also shown to inhibit the chemotaxis and intracellular calcium release of human monocytes in response to the 4 main CCR1 chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CCL15, and CCL23). There was a significant inhibition of peritoneal leukocyte recruitment in rat model with sterile peritonitis. In mice models injected with 5TGM1-GFP cells, showed reduction of number of osteoclasts per bone surface (&micro;m) and reduction in the the size of osteolytic bone lesions was also observed. Although skeletal tumor burden was decreased by using CCX721, there was no effect on extraosseous (splenic) tumor burden as would be expected if CCX721 was cytotoxic to tumor cells. These observations indicated that CCX721 has no direct effect on MM cells and implicated an indirect effect via changes in the tumor microenvironment.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;31-Dec-2014;;Targeted Therapy;;Multiple Myeloma (Kahler Disease)

The drug candidate is administered orally. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a diaryl-substituted pyrazole structure. Celecoxib selectively inhibits cyclo-oxygenase-2 activity (COX-2). The basic concept of bioavailability enhancing technology is to improve bioavailabaility through achieving both recrystallizing inhibition and stabilization by transforming insoluble drug into the amjorphous form and using biocompatible polymer. The drug is developed by using Bioavailability (BA) Enhancing technology.;Celecoxib is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. The mechanism of action of celecoxib is due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. It binds with its polar sulfonamide side chain to a hydrophilic side pocket region close to the active COX-2 binding site. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, primarily via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Both COX-1 and COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of PGs and thromboxane. Inhibition of COX-2 inhibits only prostaglandin synthesis without affecting thromboxane (TXA2) production.;" In pre-clinical trials, similar pattern is observed celecoxib BA formulation and celecoxib in the beagle dog study.; Samyang Biopharmaceuticals Corporation was engaged in the development of celecoxib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

The drug candidate is administered orally. CEP-28122 is a diaminopyrimidine derivative and targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor.;CEP-28122 acts as a anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase that is essentially and transiently expressed in specific regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. ALK is also aberrantly expressed and constitutively activated in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). The overexpression of ALK in tumour cells, directs the process of malignant transformation.;" CEP-28122 is a inhibitor of recombinant ALK activity and cellular ALK tyrosine phosphorylation. It induced concentration-dependent growth inhibition/cytotoxicity of ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and neuroblastoma cells, and displayed dose-dependent inhibition of ALK tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor xenografts in mice, with substantial target inhibition (&gt;90%) for more than 12 hours following single oral dosing at 30 mg/kg. Dose-dependent antitumor activity was observed in ALK-positive ALCL, NSCLC, and neuroblastoma tumor xenografts in mice administered CEP-28122 orally, with complete/near complete tumor regressions observed following treatment at doses of 30 mg/kg twice daily or higher. Treatment of mice bearing Sup-M2 tumor xenografts for 4 weeks and primary human ALCL tumor grafts for 2 weeks at 55 or 100 mg/kg twice daily led to sustained tumor regression in all mice, with no tumor reemergence for more than 60 days postcessation of treatment. Conversely, CEP-28122 displayed marginal antitumor activity against ALK-negative human tumor xenografts under the same dosing regimens. Administration of CEP-28122 was well tolerated in mice and rats. In summary, CEP-28122 is a highly potent and selective orally active ALK inhibitor with a favorable pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic profile and robust and selective pharmacologic efficacy against ALK-positive human cancer cells and tumor xenograft models in mice.; In October 2011, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd announced that it has completed its acquisition of Cephalon, Inc which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva and ceased to be traded on NASDAQ.

Inhibition of PKCI hampers the cell wall integrity leading to cell lysis and subsequent cell death.;" Eli Lilly and Company explored the potential of targeting the Pkc1 protein kinase for developing broad-spectrum fungicidal antifungal drugs through a Candida albicans Pkc1-based high-throughput screening. They discovered that the cercosporamide, a broad-spectrum natural antifungal compound, but previously with an unknown mode of action, is a selective and highly potent fungal Pkc1 kinase inhibitor. This finding provides a molecular explanation for previous observations in which Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall mutants were found to be highly sensitive to cercosporamide. S. cerevisiae mutant cells with reduced Pkc1 kinase activity become hypersensitive to cercosporamide, and this sensitivity can be suppressed under high-osmotic growth conditions. Together, the results demonstrate that cercosporamide acts selectively on Pkc1 kinase and, thus, they provide a molecular mechanism for its antifungal activity.Cercosporamide demonstrated an in vitro IC50 of 11nM for Mnk2 and 116nM for Mnk1. Cercosporamide treatment rapidly and effectively blocked eIF4E phosphorylation in cultured cancer cells from multiple cell lineages, suppressing proliferation and soft agar colonization as well as inducing apoptosis. Oral administration of cercosporamide to xenograft-bearing mice also effectively inhibited eIF4E phosphorylation in xenografted tumor and mouse liver tissues as quickly as 30 minutes after administration and, with daily oral dosing of cercosporamide (20mpk), significantly suppressed growth of subcutaneously-implanted HCT116 human tumor xenografts. Finally, in experimental metastasis assays with the B16 mouse melanoma model, cercosporamide administration at 10 or 20 mpk significantly suppressed the outgrowth of experimental pulmonary metastases without substantially altering mouse body weight.Treatment of AML cells with cercosporamide resulted in dose-dependent suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation. Such suppression of Mnk kinase activity and eIF4E phosphorylation by cercosporamide resulted in dose-dependent suppressive effects on primitive leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) from AML patients and enhanced the antileukemic properties of cytarabine (Ara-C) or mTORC1 inhibition (rapamycin). Similarly, the combination of cercosporamide with cytarabine resulted in enhanced antileukemic responses in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. Thus it was concluded that ercosporamide suppresses phosphorylation of eIF4E and exhibits antileukemic effects, in support of future clinical-translational efforts involving combinations of Mnk inhibitors with cytarabine and/or mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of AML.In another study, they evaluated the effects of cercosporamide on eIF4E phosphorylation in the brain. Following a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg of cercosporamide in wildtype mice, they detected a decrease in eIF4E phosphorylation whereas a dose of 40 mg/kg led to an 50 percent decrease. To assess the effect of chronic cercosporamide treatment, they injected mice daily for 5 days with various concentrations of cercosporamide and subjected the mice to the three chamber social interaction test.

It is administered orally. The drug candidate selectively targets type-I protein kinase C (PKCI) and MNK1 and 2 (MAP kinase interacting kinase). It is a phytotoxin with broad-spectrum antifungal agent isolated from plant fungal pathogen Cercosporidium henningsii.;Cercosporamide is a selective potent inhibitor of Mnk1 and Mnk2 and Protein Kinase C Like I. It blocks Mnk kinase activity and selectively inhibits Mmp9 translation through reduced phosphorylation of eIF4E. Activation of PKC pathway activates the downstream MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) cascade. Rho1p GTPase binds and activates PKCI. PKCI activates the MAP kinase kinase kinase Bck1p/Slk1p. This activates MAP kinase kinases Mkk1p and Mkk2p which further activates the MAP kinase Slt2p/Mpk1p. PKC1 translocates to microtubules and regulate their dynamics. Inhibition of PKCI hampers the cell wall integrity leading to cell lysis and subsequent cell death.;" Eli Lilly and Company explored the potential of targeting the Pkc1 protein kinase for developing broad-spectrum fungicidal antifungal drugs through a Candida albicans Pkc1-based high-throughput screening. They discovered that the cercosporamide, a broad-spectrum natural antifungal compound, but previously with an unknown mode of action, is a selective and highly potent fungal Pkc1 kinase inhibitor. This finding provides a molecular explanation for previous observations in which Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall mutants were found to be highly sensitive to cercosporamide. S. cerevisiae mutant cells with reduced Pkc1 kinase activity become hypersensitive to cercosporamide, and this sensitivity can be suppressed under high-osmotic growth conditions. Together, the results demonstrate that cercosporamide acts selectively on Pkc1 kinase and, thus, they provide a molecular mechanism for its antifungal activity.Cercosporamide demonstrated an in vitro IC50 of 11nM for Mnk2 and 116nM for Mnk1. Cercosporamide treatment rapidly and effectively blocked eIF4E phosphorylation in cultured cancer cells from multiple cell lineages, suppressing proliferation and soft agar colonization as well as inducing apoptosis. Oral administration of cercosporamide to xenograft-bearing mice also effectively inhibited eIF4E phosphorylation in xenografted tumor and mouse liver tissues as quickly as 30 minutes after administration and, with daily oral dosing of cercosporamide (20mpk), significantly suppressed growth of subcutaneously-implanted HCT116 human tumor xenografts. Finally, in experimental metastasis assays with the B16 mouse melanoma model, cercosporamide administration at 10 or 20 mpk significantly suppressed the outgrowth of experimental pulmonary metastases without substantially altering mouse body weight.Treatment of AML cells with cercosporamide resulted in dose-dependent suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation. Such suppression of Mnk kinase activity and eIF4E phosphorylation by cercosporamide resulted in dose-dependent suppressive effects on primitive leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) from AML patients and enhanced the antileukemic properties of cytarabine (Ara-C) or mTORC1 inhibition (rapamycin). Similarly, the combination of cercosporamide with cytarabine resulted in enhanced antileukemic responses in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. Thus it was concluded that ercosporamide suppresses phosphorylation of eIF4E and exhibits antileukemic effects, in support of future clinical-translational efforts involving combinations of Mnk inhibitors with cytarabine and/or mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of AML.In another study, they evaluated the effects of cercosporamide on eIF4E phosphorylation in the brain. Following a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg of cercosporamide in wildtype mice, they detected a decrease in eIF4E phosphorylation whereas a dose of 40 mg/kg led to an 50 percent decrease. To assess the effect of chronic cercosporamide treatment, they injected mice daily for 5 days with various concentrations of cercosporamide and subjected the mice to the three chamber social interaction test. The 40 mg/kg 5 day regimen impaired social approach behavior in WT mice, whereas the 20 mg/kg had no significant effect. These findings, together with the resistance of Mmp9 mice to high-dose cercosporamide demonstrated that translational control of Mmp9 mRNA through eIF4E phosphorylation is a regulatory mechanism in Fmr1 mice, which could be dysregulated in FXS.; Eli Lilly and Company was developing cercosporamide.

It is developed based on translational network biology platform.;CNX-01167 is a G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) agonist. The drug candidate enhances insulin secretion and reduces HbAc1. It also reduces apoptosis and increases intracellular insulin content. GPR40 potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion through changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels/signalling. The drug candidate also reduces the beta cell stress which results in sustained and acute glycemic control.;" Connexios Life Sciences Pvt Ltd was developing CNX-011-67 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As of September 2017, the drug candidate was in preclinical (IND ready) stage of development.; In June 2014, Connexios published an article in BMC cell biology. By exposing NIT1 insulinoma cells and rat islets to a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha and IL1beta), mimicked inflammatory signaling as seen by JNK and NFkappaB activation and increased mRNA levels of TNFalpha, IL1beta and NOS2a. These changes were reversed by pharmacological activation of GPR40 by a specific, small molecule, CNX-01167. Further, GPR40 activation reduced inflammation-mediated oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses. GPR40 activation decreased inflammation-induced apoptosis as measured by key markers. These impacts of GPR40 were mediated through activation of PLC, CaMKII, calcineurin and cAMP. Cell survival was also enhanced by GPR40 activation as seen from the increased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and enhanced expression of BCL2 and PDX1 genes. GPR40 activation restored both, inflammation-mediated inhibition on insulin secretion and intracellular insulin content. In this study, provide evidences that CNX-01167 reduces inflammatory signaling and apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cell while promoting insulin secretion and synthesis. Activation of GPR40 leads to attenuation of beta-cell dysfunction caused by chronic inflammation and thus could be of immense clinical value to improve insulin secretion and beta-cell survival.The company reported that therapeutic efficacy of CNX-01167 was studied using rat and mouse islets, beta cell lines and in animal models of diabetes. The results demonstrated that CNX-01167 enhanced insulin secretion in response to oral glucose load, delayed the onset of fasting hyperglycemia by 3 weeks, reduced nonfasting glucose excursions, fasting free fatty acids and triglyceride levels and also increased PDX1 expression and insulin content thereby reduced plasma fructosamine. CNX-011-67 also showed to improve glucose mediated insulin secretion, insulin gene transcription and islet insulin content in cultured rat islets. Also enhanced glucose oxidation in the form of increased islet ATP content and overall improvement in beta cell health in the form of reduced expression of stress markers were observed.The company reported that the drug candidate was tested in cellular and animal models. Results showed that, there is an enhancement of phasic insulin secretion in response to stimulatory glucose concentration without hypoglycemia. Improvement was observed in both fasting and post-prandial glycemic levels and significant lowering of HbA1c. Increase in insulin synthesis and content was noted along with reduction in cellular stress and apoptosis. Improvement in insulin action in the periphery, leading to reduction in plasma TG and FFA levels was observed.

DDS-06E is an oral formulation of SN38, the active metabolite in the widely prescribed intravenous colon cancer drug irinotecan. Irinotecan (CPT-11) a synthetic derivative of camptothecin displays antitumor activity in a wide range of solid tumors. SN38 inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. The drug candidate is developed based on micellar Polymeric Nano-Delivery System (PNDS) technology.;Irinotecan, a prodrug, is converted to a biologically active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38) by a carboxylesterase-converting enzyme. SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptotic cell death. Because ongoing DNA synthesis is necessary for irinotecan to exert its cytotoxic effects, it is classified as an S-phase-specific agent. Cytotoxicity of SN-38 is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38.;" In animal colon tumour xenograft studies, our oral formulation, which utilizes our micellar PNDS technology, showed equal efficacy to irinotecan administered intravenously. Pre-clinical study results shows that Oral administration of DDS-06E to nude mice with HCT-116 xenografts resulted in significant reductions in tumour volume compared to vehicle controls at doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg (p  0.5). DDS-06E was well tolerated at these doses generating median survival values greater than CPT-11 and tumor volume doubling times significantly longer than control values. Intravenous CPT-11 displayed median survival values that were no longer than those of vehicle control in this study, findings that are reflected in the survival curves presented here.; In August 2011 Paladin Labs Inc. announced that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of Labopharm Inc.; Labopharm Inc (acquired by Paladin) was engaged in the development of the studies of DDS-06E for the treatment of colon cancers.

DF-2162 developed based on GPCR inhibition technology platform.;DF 2162, a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of CXCR1/2. Chemokines are critical mediators of cell migration during routine immune surveillance, inflammation, and development. Chemokines bind to G protein-coupled receptors and cause conformational changes that trigger intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell movement and activation. Activation of CXCR1 and CXCR2 causes a rise in intracellular calcium, in turn enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) that goes on to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade called the MAP kinase pathway. Inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 regulates inflammatory response.;" Company reported that in animal study, mice were treated with a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of CXCR1/2 and DF 2162. The drug candidate inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis induced by CXCR1/2 ligands but had no effect on CXCL8 binding to neutrophils.The compound inhibited neutrophil influx and inflammatory hypernociception induced by carrageenan, lipopolysaccharide and zymosan, but not hypernociception induced by dopamine and PGE2. DF 2162 had a synergistic effect with indomethacin or the absence of TNFR1 to abrogate carrageenan-induced hypernociception. Treatment with DF 2162 diminished neutrophil influx, oedema formation, disease score and hypernociception in collagen-induced arthritis.; Dompe Farmaceutici S.p.A. was engaged in the development of DF-2162 for the treatment of chronic inflammation.

The invention relates to an oral composition comprising minicapsules wherein the minicapsules comprise one or more therapeutic or prophylactic substances in a liquid, semi-liquid, or solid core. The minicapsules have release profiles to release the substance in an active form at one or more sites along the gastro-intestinal tract to maximise absorption and/or therapeutic efficiency.; Sublimity Therapeutics Limited (formerly known as Sigmoid Pharma Ltd (formerly known as Sigmoid Biotechnologies))was developing dimethyloxalylglycine for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and colitis. As of November 2015, the drug candidate was in the preclinical stage of development. ; The research team of University College Dublin, discovered a potential treatment for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Using a new class of drugs known as hydroxylase inhibitors, the research team demonstrated that they can almost completely reverse the symptoms of IBD in a mouse model. The findings have resulted in a cross-university partnership with the University of Colorado in Denver who are working on a different hydroxylase inhibitor in conjunction with UCD Conway Institute team's industry partner, Sigmoid Biotechnologies. Their work will generate strong lead compounds for future clinical trials.In January 2008, University College Dublin investigated the effects of the hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced model of murine colitis. It was noticed thst DMOG induces both HIF-1 and NF-kappaB activity in cultured intestinal epithelial cells, and is profoundly protective in dextran-sodium sulfate colitis in a manner that is at least in part reflected by the development of an anti-apoptotic phenotype in intestinal epithelial cells, which we propose reduces epithelial barrier dysfunction.

The FDT system is suitable for all age groups, but it is especially useful for children, the elderly and schizophrenic patients who have difficulty in swallowing conventional tablets and capsules.;Donepezil is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is key enzyme in the nervous system of animals. By rapid hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), AChE terminates neurotransmission at cholinergic synapses. It is a very fast enzyme, especially for a serine hydrolase, functioning at a rate approaching that of a diffusion-controlled reaction. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, increases the amount of acetylcholine in synapses and potentially enhancing brain cholinergic neurotransmission.; Samyung Biopharmaceuticals Corporation was engaged in the development of donepezil FDT for the treatment of Alzheimer's type.

EL-102 is a small molecule sulfonanilide (Toluidine Sulphonamide) chemotype with dual mode of action. EL-102 acts by targeting caspase 3/7, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 Alpha).  The drug candidate is administered orally.;EL-102 inhibit the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway and trigger apoptosis via induction of caspase 3/7. Caspase enzyme which plays a central role in the execution of the programmed cell death. E-102 also acts like antagonist of several nuclear receptors, (including PR, AR and ERR alpha) and ADORA3 GPCR. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway is central for regulating the transcription of genes in response to decreases of oxygen, or hypoxia. HIF promotes the formation of blood vessels, but it also stimulates growth and deregulates apoptotic processes in favor of cell survival. In cancer, HIF is therefore crucial for tumor growth, vascularization, formation of metastases and treatment failure. Caspases are crucial mediators of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Among them, caspase-3 is a frequently activated death protease, catalyzing the specific cleavage of many key cellular proteins. E-102 inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) which may result in decreased expression of HIF1A downstream target genes important to tumor growth and survival, a reduction in tumor cell proliferation, and then induces of tumor cell apoptosis.;" Elara Pharmaceuticals GmbH was developing EL-102 for the treatment of prostate cancer and multiple myeloma. As of January 2014, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development.; In 2011, Elara Pharmaceuticals reported that EL102 was developed from a screening campaign to develop small molecule inhibitors of the hypoxia signalling cascade. EL102 inhibits HIF1 alpha (HIF1a) signalling in cells with an IC50 of approximately 13 nM. In addition to the potent inhibition of HIF1a signalling, EL102 causes a reduction in cellular proliferation across a broad range of solid and liquid tumor cells with IC50 values in the low nM range. At these concentrations, EL102 induces caspase 3/7 and drives cells into apoptosis. Further characterisation of EL102 was undertaken in human xenografts as a single agent, where significant tumor growth reduction (TGI 69%) was observed at concentrations that did not produce significant body weight loss. Due to its favorable pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties, EL102 was subsequently selected as a clinical development candidate and entered formal pre-clinical development studies in late 2010. In December 2010, Elara Pharmaceuticals reported that EL102 potently inhibits proliferation of over 20 human myeloma cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, EL102 shows excellent efficacy on primary multiple myeloma cells derived from patient bone marrow, without major effect on the normal bone marrow microenvironment. In addition, the compound significantly inhibits tumor growth in mouse models and is well tolerated at levels significantly higher than necessary for in vitro pharmacological efficacy.; In August 2006, EMBL Enterprise Management Technology Transfer GmbH (EMBLEM) and EMBL's venture vehicle, EMBL Ventures GmbH, announce the foundation of Elara Pharmaceuticals GmbH, a start-up company that will translate basic research findings into new anti-cancer drugs.

In 2010, the university reported that preliminary preclinical studies with enalaprilat demonstrated very high efficacy in the treatment of colitis when delivered via the trans-anal route, without systemic hemodynamic side-effects. The Phase I SBIR study proposed to characterize enalaprilat's absorption potential along the entire gastrointestinal tract in diseased and healthy mice to determine if simple oral tablet dosing could be a feasible delivery strategy for enalaprilat for both ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease. Finally, the university would determine the efficacy of enalaprilat in preclinical murine models of IBD. The goal of this proposal was to develop an entirely new type of drug therapy for IBD using an existing, proven safe therapeutic, and focusing on local control of the inflammatory response, without systemic side effects. The university reported that since this class of drugs was not currently used for IBD, this approach potentially could be used as either a single therapy or added to current regimens, allowing for reduced systemic immune suppression.; In September 2009, the university entered into a master agreement with Therapeutics Systems Research Laboratories Inc (TSRL, Inc), a CRO that would cover standard procedures for performance of products as well as provisions implementing university and federal policies related to intellectual property and publication.

In preclinical MRSA models, oral doses of the compound reduced the number of bacteria by 5-6 logs in 24 hours, compared with 2.7 and 2.3 logs for intravenous vancomycin and ciprofloxacin (currently marketed antibiotics), respectively. MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a particularly dangerous bacterium as it has developed resistance to almost all current antibiotics. ADMET data reveal EV-035 as well tolerated with no adverse effects in preclinical safety parameters. EV-035 analog GC-072 exhibits potent activity against Gram+ as well as Gram- MDR pathogens. MIC50 and MIC90 against MDR Staphylococci, Streptococci and Enterococciwere 0.03 and 0.12, 0.06 and 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/l, respectively. Levofloxacin MIC50 and MIC90 were 8 and 32, 1 and 32, and 128 and 128 mg/l, respectively. Moxifloxacin exhibited similar values to levofloxacin, with 0.12 to 4 mg/l being slightly superior to levofloxacin on streptococci. GC-072 MIC50 and MIC90 against MDR Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae were 4 and 32, 4 and 32 mg/l, respectively. Levofloxacin MIC50 and MIC90 were 32 and 128, 8 and 32 mg/l, respectively. Spontaneous resistance rate of GC-072 against E. coli ATCC25922 was 2x10-10 versus 5x10-9 for ciprofloxacin. For ciprofloxacin the mutation was found to be S83L in gyrA, whereas most of the GC-072 mutants show mutation G81D.; Evolva Holding SA  presented extensive preclinical data on EV-035 at ICAAC. Preclinical data on the compound show a broad spectrum of activity against some of the most challenging bacteria, sometimes referred to as ‘Superbugs’. The compound’s spectrum includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, including those resistant to quinolones. EV-035 is particularly potent against Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Staphylococcus. In preclinical MRSA models, oral doses of the compound reduced the number of bacteria by 5-6 logs in 24 hours, compared with 2.7 and 2.3 logs for intravenous vancomycin and ciprofloxacin (currently marketed antibiotics), respectively. ADMET data reveal EV-035 as well tolerated with no adverse effects in preclinical safety parameters. Good oral bioavailability and a large volume of distribution (in mouse models) warrant exploitation of EV-035 in major bacterial disease indications, including those of intracellular pathogens.; Evolva SA reported that they were seeking to move EV-035 product family into the hands of new owners – whether through partnering or spin-out into a new company.In 2011 Evolva continued SAR (Structure- Activity Relationship) work around the EV- 035 series in order to select the final lead compound. More than 120 analogs were tested against a large panel of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. Superior activity over reference antibiotics was observed in vitro, in particular against a large collection of quinolone-resistant strains. Spontaneous resistance experiments showed a very low rate of resistant mutants with amino acid changes in a different site than the classical quinolone site.; In December 2014, Evolva Holding SA announced that Emergent BioSolutions Inc.has acquired Evolva's anti-bacterial programme, the EV-035 series.For Evolva, this transaction is worth up to USD 70.5 million plus royalties.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;26-Oct-2017;;;;"Anthrax; Haemophilus influenzae Infections; Tularaemia; Burkholderia pseudomallei Infections (Melioidosis); Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pneumonia"

The drug candidate is administered orally. It targets ATP synthase. It belongs to the class of beta-sulphonyl carboxamides.;FAS-20013 is an ATP synthase inhibitor. Upon the administration of the drug candidate, the elements responsible for the organism's essential energy production are severely damaged within a few minutes. This is because the concentration of ATP and function of the enzyme ATP synthase fall to near nil. Shortly thereafter the synthesis of vital cellular proteins and cell-wall mycolic acids is severely impaired. A chain of events is initiated that leads promptly to the death of the organism.

FAS20013 proved to be powerfully bactericidal against anaerobically adapted Mycobacterium bovis BCG in the Wayne Model, i.e., against anaerobically non-replicating persistence. FAS20013 killed anaerobically adapted BCG at concentrations ranging from 1.5 micrograms/ml (60% killing activity) to 50 micrograms/ml concentration (99%+ killing activity). FAS20013 also demonstrated potent sterilizing activity against rifampin- tolerant persisters, with an average reduction in viable cells of 1.5 log at all concentrations tested. Taken together, these findings support a conclusion that FAS20013 is active against latent TB bacilli in vivo and should support a substantially shortened course of therapy against the active disease. This is additional evidence that FAS20013 represents the basis for an entirely new, safe and effective therapy for drug sensitive and resistant forms of TB.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;04-Feb-2010;;;;Tuberculosis

The drug candidate is administered orally as a spray. It is a formulation of the synthetic opiate, fentanyl from the phenylpiperidine class. The drug candidate interacts with opiate receptors decreasing pain impulse transmission at the spinal cord level and higher in the CNS. It is a mu-opiate receptor agonist. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission through G-proteins that activate effector proteins. The delivery of the drug candidate is based upon the NovaMist technology. The technology describes the delivery of liquid formulations of pharmaceutical product to the oral cavity in the form of a mist that covers the oral mucosal membranes. The oral mucosa is richly supplied with blood vessels and the mucosal membrane is relatively permeable. As a result, contact with these surfaces enables rapid drug absorption into the systemic circulation.;NVD-501 (fentanyl) was a mu-receptor agonist. It is an opioid analgesic that increases pain threshold, alters pain reception and inhibits ascending pain pathways by binding to stereospecific receptors within the CNS. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Fentanyl's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine.

It also decreases HCV-based luciferase activity and also inhibits Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of HepG2 cells. FGI-104 also decreases HIV infection of MT-4 cells for HBV or HCV. FGI-104 may be effective in treating multiple viral infections through inhibition of TSG101 protein.;" Dr. M. Javad Aman founder of Integrated BioTherapeutics (IBT) discovered the small molecule inhibitors of filoviruses currently in development by Functional Genetics Inc. under a DTRA funded program.; FGI-104 is well-tolerated, with LD50 values greater than 1 g/kg in mice (as compared with the efficacy observed herein at 10 mg/kg). HepG2 cells expressing HBV replicons was treated for 72 hours in the presence or absence of FGI-104, with vehicle treated samples providing a negative control. FGI-104 inhibited HBV infection of HepG2 cells and in a dose-dependent manner, with an estimated EC50 of 20 nM. Huh7 cells were infected with luciferase expressing HCV JFH-1 virus for 72 hours in the presence of absence of FGI-104. Luciferase-based readouts of viral release into the culture supernatant demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of HCV replication by FGI-104. FGI-104 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of the propagation of additional viruses, including Cowpox, VEE and Ebola viruses. In light of the fact that cell-based assays indicated a much higher EC50 value for Ebola (10 µM) than HBV or HCV, these findings suggest a high relative safety margin for FGI-104. Thus, the work described with a handful of blood-borne or biothreat agents could have a much more far-reaching impact for combating viral diseases. FGI-104 demonstrates broad-spectrum inhibition of multiple blood-borne pathogens (HCV, HBV, HIV) as well as emerging biothreats (Ebola, VEE, Cowpox, PRRSV infection in-vivo.; Functional Genetics, Inc. was engaged in the development of FGI-104 for the treatment of hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV including Ebola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), Cowpox, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) infections.

It is a small molecule administered orally. It acts by targeting P21-activated kinases or PAKs.;FRAX-597 is an inhibitor of P21-activated kinases or PAKs. Transformation of a normal cell to a cancer cell is caused by mutations in genes that regulate proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. Small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, Rac and Cdc42 orchestrate many of the signals that are required for malignant transformation. The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are effectors of Rac and Cdc42. They act as key signal transducers in several cancers signaling pathways, including Ras, Raf, NF kappaB, Akt, Bad and p53 and thus targeting P21-activated kinases may help in treating the disease.;" The Scripps Research Institute conducted a study on FRAX-597, an inhibitor of the p21-activated kinases which inhibits tumorigenesis of NF2-associated schwannomas. The study showed that high-throughput screening of a library of small molecules combined with a structure-activity relationship approach resulted in the identification of FRAX-597, a small-molecule pyridopyrimidinone, as a potent inhibitor of the group I PAKs. Crystallographic characterization of the FRAX-597/PAK1 complex identifies a phenyl ring that traverses the gatekeeper residue and positions the thiazole in the back cavity of the ATP binding site, a site rarely targeted by kinase inhibitors. FRAX-597 inhibited the proliferation of NF2-deficient schwannoma cells in culture and displayed potent anti-tumor activity in vivo, impairing schwannoma development in an orthotopic model of NF2.; The Scripps Research Institute have been awarded nearly USD1 million from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the National Institutes of Health, to develop a genetically engineered animal model of a debilitating inherited disease like neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)  that could accelerate the development of potential treatments.; The Scripps Research Institute was investigating FRAX-597 for the treatment of neurofibromatoses type II (inherited cancer).

As of July 2001, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; In 2001, Genzyme released Pre-clinical data supporting Genz-78132. In Pre-clinical studies Genz-78132 is at least 20 times more potent in vivo than 117, the most potent DNJ derivative. Genz-78132 was at least 20 times more potent in vivo than AMP-DNJ, at inhibiting the re-accumulation of the substrate globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in liver tissues in a Fabry mouse model following a single infusion of alpha-galactosidase. Genzyme believes that the high specificity of Genz-78132 will likely result in the absence of the associated adverse side effects that have been observed in the non-specific sugar analogs. Genz-78132 was well tolerated at the doses studied in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Cell viability in vitro was maintained at 100 percent at high doses, suggesting an acceptable toxicity profile. With the sugar analogs in vitro cell death was observed at much lower doses, suggesting a more narrow therapeutic window. In Genzyme's Pre-clinical studies, the potency and efficacy of oral delivery of Genz-78132 was confirmed, as measured by a significant decrease of glucosylceramide levels in the liver, kidneys, and spleen of normal mice after three days of treatment.; Sanofi-aventis and Genzyme Corporation announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which sanofi-aventis is to acquire Genzyme for $74.00 per share in cash, or approximately $20.1 billion.

The (14) C-radio labeled mass balance study in rats observed the conversion of pyrimidine to pyrazole in three metabolites. Studies with rat recombinant enzymes identified that CYP2D2 generated the N-hydroxypyrazole metabolite from GNE-892. The data  proceeded through multiple steps from the precursor, pyrimidine N-oxide and proposed a mechanism in which the pyrimidine is activated via N-oxidation followed by a second oxidative process that opens the pyrimidine ring to form a formamide intermediate. After hydrolysis of the formamide, a carbon is lost as formic acid, together with ring closure to form the pyrazole ring which determines the biotransformation of the pyrimidine to a pyrazole for GNE-892. They tested the dose-proportionality in cynomolgus monkey as proof-of-concept for a human micro dosing study and observed concentration-dependency for substrate turnover and the relative contribution of P450- versus AO-mediated metabolism in cryopreserved monkey hepatocytes. The data demonstrated differences in the affinities of P450 and AO for GNE-892 which supported the concentration-dependent metabolic shift. Mass balance studies in monkeys were conducted to test if this metabolic shift occurred in vivo.

The drug candidate is administered through oral route. GS3-978 is a selective allosteric positive modulator of metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor (GABA-B). GS-39783 have anxiolytic-like effects and is genotoxic probably because of its aromatic nitro group. GTP gamma S binding by themselves. These positive modulators enhance the effects of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) through actions at an allosteric site and are devoid of intrinsic agonistic activity.;GS-39783 activates the GABA(B) receptor and allosteric modulation is the basic mechanism of the drug candidate. GABAB receptors can also reduce the activity of adenylyl cyclase and decrease the cell’s conductance to Ca2+. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further neuronal excitation of the cell. The GABA receptor when acted up on by modulators results in decrease of the neuronal activity. The receptors are coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell. The receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, GABA and GABAB receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors act post and pre-synaptically to inhibit neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. GABAB receptors plays a crucial role in a large number of CNS disorders such as cognition deficits, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, pain and drug addiction. Thus, GS-39783 could be effective for the treatment of anxiety, pain, drug addiction and central nervous system disorders.;" In March 2006, a preclinical study of positive allosteric modulator GS-39783 in rat striatum in vivo was initiated. The purpose of this study was to monitor the changes in extracellular levels of cyclic AMP following GABA(B) receptor activation in the striatum of freely moving rats using microdialysis. The study suggested that there was no detectable endogenous activation of GABA(B) receptors controlling cyclic AMP formation in rat striatum. The study results provided the first biochemical demonstration of in vivo activity of a G protein-coupled receptor-positive allosteric modulator. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of the novel GABAB-positive modulator GS-39873 to modulate the behavioral effects of cocaine. Drugs of abuse such as cocaine lower brain reward thresholds obtained using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Results demonstrate here that GS-39783 had no intrinsic effects on ICSS reward thresholds (10-100 mg/kg p.o.) in rats, Moreover, both GS-39783 attenuated the threshold lowering effect of cocaine administration (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) in a dose-related manner. These data strongly suggest that activation of GABAB receptors attenuates the rewarding effects of acute cocaine. Therefore, GABAB-positive modulation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cocaine dependence and possibly other drugs of abuse without the side effects of full GABAB receptor agonists.; Novartis was engaged in the development of GS-39783  for the treatment of central nervous system disorders including anxiety disorders, cocaine abuse and alcohol addiction.

The study summarizes the in vitro effects of GS-8374 on adipocyte functions and characterizes the in vivo potential of GS-8374 to affect glucose disposal in a rat model, in comparison with key marketed PIs. The clinical use of HIV PIs in combination with other antiretroviral drugs dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection. However, adverse metabolic effects induced by antiretroviral therapies remain one of the major factors often limiting their long-term clinical benefit. Notably, many of the first generation HIV PIs are known to contribute to the development of lipodystrophy and peripheral insulin resistance.In vitro studies have demonstrated that some PIs can inhibit lipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, it has been shown that PIs such as ritonavir and lopinavir induce insulin resistance in vitro by reducing glucose transport mediated by the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4; conversely, atazanavir has been shown to have minimal effects on insulin sensitivity in vitro,9 and these profi les were respectively confi rmed in vivo.Company reported that optimization of the linker and phosphonate moieties led to the identification of GS-8374 (1).

The drug candidate is administered orally. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease. IDX136 lacks a covalent binding moiety and bind with low nanomolar potencies. The HCV-encoded serine protease (NS3 serine protease) is essential for viral replication and, hence, is an attractive target for HCV-specific antiviral therapy. HCV protease is necessary for polypeptide processing and viral replication. This approximately 3000 amino acid polyprotein contains, from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus, a nucleocapsid protein (C), envelope proteins (E1 and E2) and several non-structural proteins (NS1, 2, 3, 4a, 5a and 5b). The NS3 protease is considered a member of the chymotrypsin family because of similarities in protein sequence, overall three-dimensional structure and mechanism of catalysis.;IDX136 is a macrocyclic HCV protease inhibitor. Macrocyclic compounds mimic peptide substrates of the hepatitis C viral protease and inhibit the viral protease, more particularly as inhibitors of the NS3 serine protease from hepatitis C virus. HCV NS3/4A serine protease is considered to be an essential enzyme for the replication of the virus. These macrocyclic compounds also interfere with the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus. The HCV NS3 serine protease is responsible for proteolysis of the polypeptide (polyprotein) at the NS3/NS4a, NS4a/NS4b, NS4b/NS5a and NS5a/NS5b junctions and is thus responsible for generating four viral proteins during viral replication. This has made the HCV NS3 serine protease an attractive target for antiviral chemotherapy;" Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. was engaged in the development of IDX136 for the treatment of  hepatitis C infections.

The drug candidate is administered orally. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease. IDX136 binds with low nanomolar potencies. The HCV-encoded serine protease (NS3 serine protease) is essential for viral replication and, hence, is an attractive target for HCV-specific antiviral therapy. HCV protease is necessary for polypeptide processing and viral replication. This approximately 3000 amino acid polyprotein contains, from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus, a nucleocapsid protein (C), envelope proteins (E1 and E2) and several non-structural proteins (NS1, 2, 3, 4a, 5a and 5b). NS3 is an approximately 68 kda protein, encoded by approximately 1893 nucleotides of the HCV genome, and has two distinct domains like serine protease domain consisting of approximately 200 of the N-terminal amino acids and an RNA-dependent ATPase domain at the C-terminus of the protein.;IDX316 is a macrocyclic HCV protease inhibitor. Macrocyclic compounds mimic peptide substrates of the hepatitis C viral protease and inhibit the viral protease, more particularly as inhibitors of the NS3 serine protease from hepatitis C virus.  HCV NS3/4A serine protease is considered to be an essential enzyme for the replication of the virus. These macrocyclic compounds also interfere with the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus. The HCV NS3 serine protease is responsible for proteolysis of the polypeptide (polyprotein) at the NS3/NS4a, NS4a/NS4b, NS4b/NS5a and NS5a/NS5b junctions and is thus responsible for generating four viral proteins during viral replication. This has made the HCV NS3 serine protease an attractive target for antiviral chemotherapy.;" As of April 2009, The company selected IDX136 and IDX316 as lead clinical candidates from HCV protease inhibitor discovery program and are currently conducting IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies.; Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. was engaged in the development of IDX316 for the treatment of hepatitis C infections. As of April 2009, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development. In August 2014, Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc was acquired by Merck.; IDX316 has demonstrated potent and selective in vitro activity against HCV NS3/4A protease and replicons in earlier studies. This study evaluated in vitro biochemical and cell-based activities of IDX316 as well as their pharmacokinetic profile in the mouse, rat and monkey. The binding kinetics of IDX316 to NS3/4A were determined by surface plasmon resonance. The results demonstrated that IDX316 is a potent and selective inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease (genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, and 4a). during the study, IDX316 binds to protease tightly, with an equilibrium constant (KD) less than 3 nM, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Association (kon) was fast, and dissociation (koff) was very slow, with a dissociation half-life (t1/2) of nearly 17 minutes. IDX316 did not significantly inhibit (IC50 &gt; 24 µM) eight cellular proteases. IDX316 is a potent inhibitor of genotype 1b HCV replicon replication in cell culture with a high selectivity index. Long-term treatment of replicon cells with IDX316 resulted in a multilog reduction in replicon RNA. The activities of IDX316 were examined in 14-day treatment assays in the absence of G418. Long-term treatment with IDX316 at concentrations above the EC50 effectively suppressed RNA replication compared to the untreated control. These concentrations of 5x to 20x EC50 gave high levels of suppression (approximately 3 log10 at 20x EC50). The suppression was maintained over the 14 days with no evidence of RNA rebound or visible cytotoxicity. In the presence of G418, a dose-dependent reduction in replicon-bearing colonies was observed after IDX316 treatment from too many to count (&gt; 600; no drug) to =10 (20x EC50). IDX316 exhibits additive activity in combination with other HCV drug classes. IDX316 exhibits additive activity in combination with other HCV drug classes. Enhanced activity corresponding to additivity was observed when IDX316 was combined with IFN-a, RBV, IDX184 or IDX375. Similar combination effects were observed with IDX136. The pharmacokinetic parameters of  IDX316 were studied in rodent and non-human primate species. The plasma half-life of IDX316 ranged from 4.0 to 5.2 h in mice, rats and monkeys. The oral bioavailability of IDX316 was nearly 20% in mice, rats and monkeys. IDX316 was selectively concentrated in the liver in rats given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg; liver levels at 8 and 24 h were 280- and 60-times the corresponding plasma concentrations. IDX316 was not cytotoxic to freshly isolated mouse, rat, monkey or human hepatocytes in vitro (CC50 &gt; 10 µM). No significant inhibition of human CYP450 by IDX316 was observed. Monkeys given 10 or 100 mg/kg oral doses of IDX316 for 7 days showed no adverse effects, including no meaningful changes in clinical chemistries and no histological abnormalities.; Merck and Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck will acquire Idenix for $24.50 per share in cash. The transaction, which values the purchase of Idenix at approximately $3.85 billion, has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;16-Apr-2009;;;;

It is administered orally. The drug candidate targets nuclear receptor-related1 (Nurr1) or retinoid X receptor (RXR). The drug candidate is a disease modifying, non-dopaminergic agent.;IVA-360 is a orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1/RXR agonist. Nurr1 plays a key role in the maintenance of the dopaminergic system. It is critical for the development and survival of dopaminergic cells. It also controls the expression of proteins involved in the synthesis and uptake of dopamine such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Potentiation of Nurr1/RXR activity supports events which might restore the dopamine balance in Parkinsonian brain.;" In December 2013, Inventiva SAS presented an abstract on “A selective NURR1/RXR activator for treating parkinson's disease at 20th World Congress on Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders, Geneva, Switzerland. Abstract reported about the selective Nurr1/RXR activator for treating Parkinson’s disease. Results showed that in vitro, IVA360 antagonized cell death induced by neurotoxins in mesencephalic primary cell cultures. IVA360 neuroprotective activity was completely blocked by co-treatment with an RXR antagonist. In mice, the compound administered orally showed good brain penetration and was able to dose-dependently reverse the effects of sub-acute and acute MPTP on dopamine level in the striatum and TH-positive cell loss in the midbrain. Neuroprotection was also observed when IVA360 was administered after 6-OHDA intoxication in rats. Most interestingly, when administered after 6-OHDA, chronic treatment with IVA360 translates into full recovery of functional/motor activity.In 2012, Inventiva reported successful validation of IVA-360 in several established in vitro and in vivo Parkinson's Disease (PD) models of neurodegeneration. The In vitro outcomes are primary dopaminergic neurons, MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) induced neuronal death and spontaneous neurodegeneration. In vivo studies were performed on rodents. The outcomes are MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) intoxication and 6-OH-DA (6-hydroxydopamine) intoxication.; Inventiva was engaged in the development of IVA-360 for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD).

Four days after orthotopic implantation of 1&times; 105 NSC11 glioma stem cells, mice were randomized to treatment with bevacizumab, JNJ-28312141, or the combination of bevacizumab plus JNJ-28312141 and followed for survival. JNJ-28312141 did not prolong survival compared to control. However, JNJ-28312141 combined with bevacizumab significantly reduced tumor vascularity. Bevacizumab increased the expression of YKL-40 compared to controls and this increase in expression was significant blocked in the mice treated with the combination of bevacizumab and JNJ -28312141. In November 2009, Johnson & Johnson reported a novel orally active colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor/FMS-related receptor tyrosine kinase-3 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential utility in solid tumors, bone metastases, and acute myeloid leukemia. It reported report the efficacy of a novel orally active CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) kinase inhibitor, JNJ-28312141, in proof of concept studies of solid tumor growth and tumor-induced bone erosion. H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not express CSF-1R and were not growth inhibited by JNJ-28312141 in vitro. Nevertheless, daily p.o. administration of JNJ-28312141 caused dose-dependent suppression of H460 tumor growth in nude mice that correlated with marked reductions in F4/80(+) tumor-associated macrophages and with increased plasma CSF-1, a possible biomarker of CSF-1R inhibition. Furthermore, the tumor microvasculature was reduced in JNJ-28312141-treated mice, consistent with a role for macrophages in tumor angiogenesis. In separate studies, JNJ-28312141 was compared with zoledronate in a model in which MRMT-1 mammary carcinoma cells inoculated into the tibias of rats led to severe cortical and trabecular bone lesions. Both agents reduced tumor growth and preserved bone. However, JNJ-28312141 reduced the number of tumor-associated osteoclasts superior to zoledronate.

The drug candidate is administered through intravenous and oral route. The drug candidate is a NK-1 receptor antagonist. NK-1 receptors have a widespread distribution in brain including the hippo-campus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide released within amygdala, after binding to NK-1 receptor it regulates many biological functions in the central nervous system such as emotional behavior, stress, migraine, depression and anxiety. NK-1 receptor antagonists specifically inhibit the above-mentioned biological functions mediated by SP. NK-1 receptor antagonists exert an anxiyolitic, antidepressant, antimigraine or neuroprotector effect in the central nervous system.;L-822429 is a neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. The drug candidate acts as an anti-anxiolytic agent. NK-1 receptors after binding to SP increase anxiety related behaviours in certain brain areas including amygdala. The drug candidate blocks the NK-1 receptors resulting in altered basal or stress evoked SP release in medial amygdala. L-822429 may prove to be effective in the treatment of anxiety by checking the underlying cause.;" In July 2008, Merck Research Laboratories conducted preclinical studies entitled “Modulation of basal and stress-induced amygdaloid substance P release by the potent and selective NK1 receptor antagonist L-822429”. The purpose of the study was to test whether blocking NK-1 receptors will result in altered basal and stress evoked release of SP in the medial amygdala. Pharmacokinetic profiling of L-822429 was done in rats and it was found to be bioavailable with half life of 2 hours. The drug candidate showed high affinity to rat cloned NK-1 receptors and displayed excellent selectivity over NK2 and NK3 receptors. It was found that intra amygdaloid administration of L-822429 via inverse micro dialysis enhanced basal, but attenuated swim stress-induced SP release.; Merck & Co., Inc. was engaged in the development of L-822429 for the treatment of anxiety.

The drug candidate is based on the core structure of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).;Lenabasum (JBT-101) is a synthetic cannabinoid CB1/CB2 agonist. The cannabinoid system plays a direct role in pain signaling via the CB1 and CB2 receptors as well as indirectly via the vanilloid TRPV1 receptor (aka the capsaicin receptor). Activation of CB1- and CB2- receptors has a direct dampening influence on the acquisition and transmission of neuropathic pain signals resulting from sensitized nociceptors. An imbalance of nociceptive and mechanoreceptive signaling caused by damage to or loss of small C- and large Ab-/d-fibers, results in an increase of pain impulses reaching the spinal cord dorsal horn. Peripherally, the CB receptors plays an important role in the modulation of pain signaling by modulation of neuroglia and immune cells through neuro-immune crosstalk.;" &lt;p&gt;Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc, has completed the private placement of 1,500,000 shares of its common stock to an institutional investor under the January 2018 sales agreement for which the company received net proceeds of approximately USD 11.2 million.

In another LGD-3303 study on female rodents (ovaries removed) and male rodents (testes removed), treated with LGD-3303, it was again shown to be a potent SARM with anabolic effects on muscle and cortical bone. Research indicates that it has the potential to be more effective than Fosamax at increasing bone mineral density in the femur and spine, by the deposition of new bone in those areas. LGD-3303 has potent activity on levator ani muscle but is a partial agonist on the preputial gland and ventral prostate. LGD-3303 never stimulated ventral prostate above intact levels despite increasing plasma concentrations of compound. Tissue-selective activity was maintained when LGD-3303 was dosed orally or by continuous infusion, two routes of administration with markedly different time versus exposure profiles. Despite the greater muscle activity relative to prostate activity, local tissue concentrations of LGD-3303 were higher in the prostate than in the levator ani muscle. LGD-3303 has SARM properties that are independent of its pharmacokinetic profile, suggesting that the principle mechanism for tissue-selective activity is the result of altered molecular interactions at the level of the androgen receptor. Pre-clinical studies indicate that the compound may have utility for osteoporosis, male and female sexual dysfunction, frailty and male hypogonadism. In vivo studies in rodents indicate a favorable profile with anabolic effects on bone, but an absence of the prostatic hypertrophy that occurs with the currently marketed androgens.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;17-Jun-2009;;Targeted Therapy;;

The drug candidate was administered orally. It targets NS5B polymerase. LGD-7501 was a HepDirect prodrug of 2’-C methylguanosine and increases liver targeting. The drug candidate was based on HepDirect liver-targeting technology platform.;LGD-7501 was a NS5B polymerase inhibitor. Hepatitis C virus NS5B modulates cell cycle progression. NS5B polymerase participates in RNA synthesis as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It is essential for viral replication. The HCV NS5B polymerase is capable of initiating RNA synthesis de novo, i.e. in the absence of a primer. The initiation phase requires the polymerase to catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two bound nucleotides, referred to as priming and initiating nucleotides. In the rate-limiting step that follows, the newly formed dinucleotide is used as a primer for the addition of the third nucleotide.;" Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated announced that data from preclinical studies evaluating Ligand's HepDirect liver-targeting technology platform will be featured in a poster presentation at the 48th Annual International Liver Congress hosted by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Amsterdam. The data show highly targeted liver delivery of a clinically active NS5B polymerase inhibitor utilizing the HepDirect technology platform, and demonstrated that HepDirect liver targeting of active nucleosides may be an effective method to improve efficacy while reducing systemic side effects in HCV treatment.In preclinical studies, Ligand evaluated the pharmacokinetics and liver targeting of LGD-7501. The compound using HepDirect technology efficiently targeted the liver with greatly reduced systemic distribution in preclinical models, providing further proof-of-concept of the value and utility of the HepDirect technology platform. Researchers reported that in preclinical studies, they have evaluated the pharmacokinetics and liver targeting of LGD-7501, compared to other phosphoramidate prodrugs of the same active nucleoside. They added, the compound using HepDirect technology efficiently targeted the liver with greatly reduced systemic distribution in preclinical models.; Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was developing LGD-7501 for the treatment of Hepatitis C infections. As of May 2017, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;11-May-2017;;;;

";73-78-9;Lidocaine hydrochloride was under development for the treatment of pain. The drug candidate is administered through transbuccal and topical route.It acts by targeting sodium channels. The drug candidate is developed based on NexACT drug delivery technology.;Lidocaine acts as sodium channel blocker. The drug candidate stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Lidocaine belongs to a class of local and topical anesthetic medications. As lidocaine causes a temporary numbness or loss of sensation when injected in the tissues, it is used as a local anesthetic and in the treatment of pain. Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage gated sodium (Na+) channels in the neuronal cell membrane, which are responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockade, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and so fail to transmit an action potential, leading to its anaesthetic effects.;" &lt;p&gt;&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt;

The drug candidate is administered orally. The drug candidate acts by targeting SSAO (AOC3/VAP-1).;LJP-1207 is an SSAO inhibitor. SSAO/VAP-1 regulates leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs). SSAO/VAP-1 is involved in the adhesion cascade at sites where induction/activation of selectins, chemokines, immunoglobulin superfamily molecules, and integrins takes place. The SSAO activity is directly involved in the pathway of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells by a mechanism involving direct interaction with an amine substrate presented on a VAP-1 ligand expressed on the surface of a leukocyte. Inhibition of VAP-1 enzymatic activity by SSAO inhibitors, also results in a reduction in the number of rolling and firmly bound lymphocytes. Thus, inhibitors of SSAO/VAP-1 enzymatic activity could reduce leukocyte adhesion in areas of inflammation and thereby reduce leukocyte trafficking into the inflamed region and, consequently, reduce the inflammatory process itself.;" &lt;p&gt;La Jolla Pharmaceutical Co. has filed a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public offering of securities, to raise aggregate gross proceeds of up to USD 150 million.

The effect of LJP 1207 (IC(50) human SSAO 17 nM; ratio IC(50) SSAO:MAO &gt;5000), on relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mouse model. In a mouse model of ulcerative colitis, LJP 1207 significantly reduced mortality, loss of body weight, and colonic cytokine levels. Quantitative histopathological assessment of colitis activity in this model showed a highly significant suppression of inflammation, injury, and ulceration scores in the animals treated with the SSAO/VAP-1 inhibitor. LJP 1207 also reduced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice and prolonged survival post-LPS-induced endotoxemia. Therapeutic and prophylactic administration of LJP 1207 in the rat carrageenan footpad model also markedly inhibited swelling and inflammation.

The drug candidate is administered orally. It targets transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK-1).;LYTAK1 is a TAK-1 inhibitor. TAK1 is an essential mediator of the constitutive activation of NF-kappa B in pancreatic cancer cells. Activation of TAK-1 by pro-inflammatory cytokines and T and B cell receptors induces the nuclear localization of nuclear factors and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP1 and P38. These play important roles in mediating inflammation, immune responses, T and B cell activation, apoptosis and epithelial cell survival. Knocking down the expression of TAK1 suppresses the auto-phosphorylation of residual TAK1 proteins and reduces the phosphorylation of p38 which is a downstream target of the TAK1-MKK6 intracellular pathway.;" Eli Lilly and Company was developing LYTAK1 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. As of July 2011, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; The activity of the TAK1-kinase selective inhibitor LYTAK1 was tested in vitro. Four pancreatic cancer cell lines – AsPc-1, PANC-1, MDAPanc-28, and Colo357FG – were exposed for 24 hours to increasing doses of LYTAK1. LYTAK1 had potent in vitro cytotoxic activity, demonstrating an IC50 between 5 and 40 nM. At this dose range, the kinase activity of TAK1 was markedly inhibited as indicated by the suppression of the autophosphorylation of TAK1 and the phosphorylation of p38.Another in vitro study to demonstrate that the inhibition of the kinase activity of TAK1 would suppress the activation of NF-kappaB was conducted. The effect of LYTAK1 was studied on the DNA binding activity of this transcriptional factor. It was observed that in the concentration range indicated, LYTAK1 was able to completely suppress the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in the pancreatic cancer cell lines. In addition, preclinical trials were conducted to know if the inhibition of TAK1 is effective in reducing chemoresistance to therapeutic drugs against pancreatic cancer. In vivo activity of oral LYTAK1 was evaluated in an orthotopic nude mouse model with luciferase-expressing AsPc-1 pancreatic cancer cells. LYTAK1 also potentiated the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents oxaliplatin, SN-38, and gemcitabine in AsPc-1, PANC-1, and MDAPanc-28 cells compared with control cells. In nude mice, oral administration of LYTAK1 plus gemcitabine statistically significantly reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival duration. The results of this study suggest that genetic silencing or inhibition of TAK1 kinase activity in vivo is a potential therapeutic approach to reversal of the intrinsic chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;08-Jul-2011;;Targeted Therapy;;Pancreatic Cancer

Initial studies, conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Max Baker at the University of Iowa, showed that substitution at the para position of propofol, yielded a compound having reduced anesthetic or sedative effects while maintaining anti-convulsant properties in the 6 Hz (32 mA) mouse model conducted at the anti-convulsant screening program (ASP), NINDS. Propofol and MB-003, both exhibited lower ED50s than many other anti-convulsant drugs including valproic acid, felbamate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ethosuximide. Therefore, the substantially reduced sedative activity for MB-003 compared to propofol, allowed for the possibility of wider use of this compound for seizure treatment.; In June 2013, Max T. Baker (Co founder of Tansna Therapeutics) filed a patent with the application number (PCT/US2013/045746) entitled “Substituted phenols having anticonvulsant properties ” The present invention relates to substituted phenol compounds and methods of using the compounds.; Tansna Therapeutic Inc (a spin-off of University of Iowa) was developing MB-003 for the treatment of refractory partial seizures and neuropathic pain.

The drug candidate is administered orally. It is a conjugate of vitamin B6 and alendronate. The development of the drug candidate is based on the company's bone targeting technology and molecular design technology. The technologies links vitamin B6 to a drug of interest and deliver the drugs. The drug candidate inhibits the osteoclastic function and may aid in the treatment of the condition.;MBC-31 elicits anti-osteoporotic activity. Alendronate inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase enzyme. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signaling proteins. This results in the inhibition of osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. Bisphosphonates (BP) have high affinity for hydroxyapatite in bone matrix where it is released and incorporated by the osteoclast during bone resorption. Once the drug reaches intracellular compartment, BP disrupts osteoclast function.;" In March 2006, the company reported a study of vitamin B6 derivative of alendronate rapidly absorbed following oral administration. The company developed a vitaminB6-bisphosphonate conjugate with improved absorption as compared to alendronate. They used 14C-radiolabeled alendronate and labeled alendronate-vitamin B6 conjugate MBC-31 for pharmacokinetic studies. In rats dosed orally, the Cmax of MBC-31 (6.3 microg/ml) was double that of alendronate, and the Tmax of MBC-31 was 5 minutes as compared to 30 minutes for alendronate. While the oral bioavailability (0.7percentage) was essentially unchanged by conjugation, the clearance of MBC-31 from plasma was nearly doubled and might suggested an increase in tissue absorption. Furthermore, the distribution of alendronate and MBC-31 to bone appeared to be equivalent. Data from an estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss ovariectomized rat model of osteoporosis revealed that MBC-31 has induced reduction of serum and urine biomarkers of bone turnover and improved the total bone density. MBC-31 traffics to the bone at levels similar to alendronate, Equimolar dosing of MBC-31 and alendronate provided similar AUC values. The data did not indicate the extent to which alendronate is released from MBC-31. Overall, the data supported the concept of using vitamin B6 conjugation to improve the absorption of bisphosphonates, which would lead to an improved oral dosing regimen for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. In January 2006, the company reported that they performed three important pharmacokinetic experiments: pilot toxicology, distribution to bone and oral absorption for their lead osteoporosis drug candidate MBC-31 (vitamin B6-Fosmax). In each of these experiments, MBC-31 was directly compared to the related and well established active ingredient osteoporosis drug Fosamax. Collectively, the results of these three preliminary experiments suggested their technology holds real promise as a potential new osteoporosis drug.; MBC Pharma, Inc was developing MBC-31 for the treatment of osteoporosis. As of March 2006,  the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; MBC Pharma, Inc. was granted a Phase I STTR fund of USD 70,000 from National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) (NIH No. 1R41AR050298-01A1) to develop bisphosphonates for the prevention of osteoporosis. In April 2001, the USPTO granted the company a patent (6,214,812) titled “Bisphosphonate conjugates and methods of making and using the same”. The patent covers bisphosphonate conjugates capable of releasing antibacterial and/or cytotoxic components upon binding with bone tissue. Such conjugates are useful in the treatment and prevention of bone cancer, bone infections and other bone-related diseases. Bisphosphonate conjugates are also delivery vehicles for use in delivering pharmaceutical compositions to bone tissue. Methods of synthesizing bisphosphonates and pharmaceutical compositions incorporating the same, and medical uses for such compositions, were provided. Compositions of the invention include bone-seeking radio isotope conjugates for use in imaging and therapy. In November 2013, the USPTO granted the company another patent (8,586,781) titled “Bone targeted therapeutics and methods of making and using the same” The patent covers bisphosphonate conjugates, pharmaceutical compositions comprising bisphosphonate conjugates and methods of using such analogs in the treatment of bone cancer, bone-related diseases, bone infection, bone inflammation, and diseases of the soft tissues surrounding bones.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;16-Mar-2006;;;;

Direct gene alterations in p53 or interaction between p53 and MDM2 proteins are two alternative mechanisms for the inactivation of p53 function. The normal functioning of the important tumor suppressor protein p53 is regulated by its binding to the MDM2 protein. Overexpression of MDM2 in some tumors is responsible for the inactivation of p53.

The drug candidate is a spirooxindole compound. It is a small molecule inhibitor of the HDM2-p53 interaction.;MI-219 is an inhibitor of HDM2-p53 interaction. An active HDM2 inhibitor (MI-219) activates the p53 pathway and is selectively toxic to tumor cells. The two proteins (HDM2 and p53) are linked by a negative regulatory feedback loop and physically bind to each other via a putative helix formed by residues 18-26 of p53 transactivation domain (TAD) and its binding pocket located within the N-terminal 100-residue domain of mdm2. Activation of the p53 protein protects against the propagation of cells that carry damaged DNA with potentially oncogenic mutations. HDM2, a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the principal cellular antagonist of p53, acting to limit the p53 growth-suppressive function in unstressed cells. In unstressed cells, HDM2 constantly monoubiquitinates p53 and thus is the critical step in mediating its degradation by nuclear and cytoplasmic proteasomes. The interaction between p53 and HDM2 is conformation-based and is tightly regulated on multiple levels. Disruption of the p53-HDM2 complex by multiple routes is the pivotal event for p53 activation, leading to p53 induction and its biological response.;" Ascenta Therapeutics was engaged in the development of MI-219 (AT-219) for the treatment of cancer.

The drug candidate is administered orally.The drug candidate inhibits the p53-HDM2 (Human Double Minute 2) protein-protein interaction.;MI-519-64 inhibits HDM2 which intern potentially leads to reactivation of p53 tumour suppressor functions. HDM2 binding to p53 leads to p53 degradation. Loss of p53 functions occurs in cancers through mutation of p53 gene and also through over expression of HDM2 protein, due to transcriptional regulation of the HDM2 gene amplification. Therefore, blocking the interaction between p53 and HDM2 in cancer cells should reactivate p53 tumor suppressor functions and enhance current cancer treatments. In cells with wild-type p53, the HDM2 protein binds to p53 in cancer cells and inhibits its activity. Inhibition of the interaction between HDM2 and p53 stimulates p53 activity and subsequently apoptosis.;" In February 2011, investigators at University of Michigan reported that design of non-peptide small-molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction is being intensely pursed as a new cancer therapeutic strategy. In the last two years, with the support of the University of Michigan SPORE grant, investigators have designed and developed a class of highly potent, non-peptide, orally available, small-molecule inhibitors of MDM2. The aim of these investigation is the determination of the in vivo antitumor activity and molecular mechanism of action of potent MDM2 inhibitors in animal models of human prostate cancer and examination of any toxicity to animals.; MI-519-64 was found to be 10-times more effective in inhibition of tumor growth in SJSA-1 xenografts and were capable of regression SJSA-1 tumors in vivo, while showing no toxicity to animals. Based upon these data, MI-519-64 has been nominated as backup compounds for clinical development. Investigators plan to focus in vivo evaluation of MI-519-64 in LNCAP and 22RV1 prostate cancer xenograft models during the 3rd year of University of Michigan SPORE project.; Sanofi and Ascenta Therapeutics, announced the signature of an exclusive global collaboration and licensing agreement on a number of compounds that could restore tumor cell apoptosis. Under this agreement, sanofi-aventis will receive an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize all compounds issued from this program. Two compounds, MI-773 and MI-519-64, are currently expected to enter preclinical development in 2010. Ascenta has in-licensed these compounds from the University of Michigan. Both sanofi-aventis and Ascenta will provide funding for the ongoing research of p53-HDM2 inhibitors at the University of Michigan and Ascenta may participate in ongoing research activities and potential future clinical development.; Sanofi was developing MI-51964 for the treatment of prostate cancer.

The drug candidate selectively induces apoptosis and inhibits growth of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-dependent organ sebaceous gland.;MK-386 acts by inhibiting 5alpha-reductase type 1. 5-Alpha reductase is also known as 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in steroid metabolism. 5a-reductase inhibitors (or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors) are a group of drugs with antiandrogenic activity, used in the treatment of acne and androgenic alopecia. These drugs decrease the levels of available 5a-reductase prior to testosterone binding with the enzyme, thus reducing levels of dihydrotestosterone that derives from such a bond. The enzyme 5a-reductase is involved in the conversion of testosterone to the active form dihydrotestosterone by reducing the delta 4,5 double-bond. In alopecia, male-pattern baldness is one of the effects of androgenic receptor activation. Reducing the levels of dihydrotestosterone thus reduces alopecia.;" Merck conducted a study to examine sequentially increasing oral doses of MK-386, an azasteroid that specifically inhibits the human 5alphaR1 isozyme in vitro. Finasteride, a selective inhibitor of 5alphaR2, was included for comparison. One hundred men were evaluated in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential, increasing dose, parallel group trial. Ten to 20 subjects received MK-386, and 2 to 5 received placebo in each of 6 panels. In 1 panel, 10 subjects received finasteride (5 mg), and 5 received placebo. Treatments were given once daily for 14 days, except in 1 panel in which MK-386 was administered 10 mg twice daily for comparison to 20 mg daily. Serum, sebum, and semen DHT concentrations and serum and sebum T concentrations were measured before and after treatment. No significant alterations in serum T were observed after any dose of MK-386. No meaningful changes were observed in serum LH after MK-386 treatment. MK-386 was generally well tolerated by all subjects; reversible aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase elevations were observed in two subjects at the 50-mg dose. Dose-dependent suppression of sebum DHT by a 5alphaR1 inhibitor suggested the potential utility of such compounds in the treatment of acne.; Merck was engaged in the development of MK-386 for the treatment acne and male pattern baldness. As of December 1997, the  drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development.; The University of Bonn has done an investigation of the inhibitory effects of MK386 [a specific inhibitor of the 5-reductase type 1 isoform ] and of finasteride [a specific inhibitor of the 5-reductase type 2 isoform (28)] on brain tissue 5-reductase activity and compared it with that on the prostate isoform type 2. It was demonstrated that MK386 is a specific inhibitor of human 5-reductase type 1, with an IC50 value of approximately 20 nmol/L for the native type 1 isoform, while an IC50 of approximately 3100 nmol/L for the native type 2 isoform was observed. Therefore, the dose-response analyses with finasteride and MK386 as inhibitors and 0.1 µmol/L androstenedione as substrate suggest the predominant, if not exclusive, activity of the 5-reductase type 1 isozyme in the mature human brain. MK386 is a strong inhibitor of human brain tissue 5-reductase activity, with an IC50 value of 2.0 nmol/L.

Carrus Capital Corporation is seeking its name change to Global Blockchain Technologies Corp.; In August 2011, BioWest Therapeutics Inc. announced that the Company obtained final TSX Venture Exchange (the ""TSXV"") approval of its previously announced change of business from a biotechnology company to an investment issuer and its application to list the common shares of the Company for trading on the TSXV as a tier 2 ""investment issuer"". Concurrently with the Company's listing on the TSXV, BioWest will change its name to Carrus Capital Corporation and its common shares will trade under the stock symbol ""CHQ"". There was no consolidation of capital. In September 2003, Mitokor was awarded a Phase I SBIR fund of USD 100,000 from National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) (NIH No. 1R43AR049145-01A1) for the project entitled “osteoarthritis/chondrocalcinosis: mitochondrial therapy”.; In the rat meniscal tear model of osteoarthritis, MITO-4042 decreased the severity of zone 3 tibial cartilage degeneration by 60%, the osteophyte scores and measurements by 44% and 45%, respectively, and the subchondral bone loss by 50%. Direct intra-articular administration of MITO-4042 inhibited tissue destruction and fibroproliferative pannus in the Type II collagen rat model of rheumatoid arthritis. Importantly, unlike certain anti-inflammatory drugs, it did not inhibit synovitis in this model indicating that the chondroprotective activities of MX-4042 are not due to an anti-inflammatory mode of action. These tissue-sparing and hence disease-modifying effects are apparently independent of inflammatory pathways, suggesting potential synergy in combination therapy with extant anti-inflammatory drugs.; Migenix inc acquired the drug candidate through the acquisition of Mitokor Inc.

Inhibitor;Small Molecule;N07XX Other nervous system drugs;;;;;;C-201(Neurodur) was under development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Neurodur is a pro-drug which is developed using targeted protease inhibitor platform technology. The drug candidate is a small molecule, neuron-targeted protease inhibitor. In autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the degradation of myelin proteins results in destabilization of the myelin sheath. Thus, proteases have been implicated in myelin protein degradation, and some studies have demonstrated that increased expression and activity of a calcium-activated neutral proteinase (calpain) in multiple sclerosis. Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic conditions characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy).;Neurodur targets the nerve cells. It is a neuron-targeted protease inhibitor. It act by binding to specific membrane transporters which enable them and their passengers to be deposited within the neuronal cells. The inhibitor, (an analogue) leupeptin, is a tripeptide produced by streptomyces strains. Neurodur is a small molecule that combines an analog of taurine, a membrane transport molecule that targets neurons, with the active portion from the tripeptide leupeptin, a known calpain inhibitor. Calpain is thought to play an important role in nerve cell degeneration. By specifically delivering leupeptin to the nerve cells and, thus, inhibiting calpain activity, it is expected that nerve tissue will be preserved. MS patients suffer from a damaging up regulation of calpain.;" CepTor Corporation (acquired by Xechem International) was engaged in the development of Neurodur (C-201) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). As of March 2006, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development. In September 2005, CepTor announced that they filed a PCT international patent application for Neurodur.

The drug candidate is a small molecule and is administered orally. It acts by targeting cellular tumor antigen p53 and myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl 1.;ONC-301 cause activation of p53. The p53 gene has been mapped to chromosome 17. In the cell, p53 protein binds DNA, which in turn stimulates another gene to produce a protein called p21 that interacts with a cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2). When p21 is complexed with cdk2 the cell cannot pass through to the next stage of cell division. Mutant p53 can no longer bind DNA in an effective way, and as a consequence the p21 protein is not made available to act as the 'stop signal' for cell division. Thus cells divide uncontrollably, and form tumors. MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member is essential for the survival of multiple cell lineages. ONC-301 restores the activity of p53 gene and suppress other anti-apoptotic proteins which may result in therapeutic effect.;" ONC-301 is safe and effective in combination in vivo, particularly in colon and thyroid cancer, and is thus a clinical stage product. ONC-301 combines favorably with anti-cancer therapies such as 5-FU, sorafenib, and TRAIL to kill tumors regardless of genetic mutations and other aberrancies that render tumors resistant to conventional therapy, including p53 dysfunction. The activation of p53 by ONC-301 has been shown in vivo along with its combinatorial antitumor activity that decreases colon cancer tumor growth and prolongs survival in mice with thyroid cancer without gross toxicity.; Oncoceutics, Inc. was engaged in the development of ONC-301 for the treatment of thyroid cancer and colon cancer.

They plays an important role in both adaptive and innate immunity.The drug candidate may check the progression of disease by limiting the underlying cause of disease progression.;OPN-501 works as a toll-like receptor antagonist. The drug candidate allows site-specific delivery of the active drug to the colon while suppressing absorption in the stomach and small intestine. Dysfunctional immune-response, involving Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and components of normal gastrointestinal gram-negative bacteria, play a key role in the pathogenesis of colitis. An early step is macrophage antigen presentation, a process involving the CD14/TLR-4 complex, which leads to interferon (IFN) production. IFNs activate macrophages to produce a variety of cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12 that upregulate expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules.

PCI-45261 is orally administered. The drug candidate inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and reduces production of these collagen autoantibodies. Bruton's tyrosine kinase is a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseasea. The Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is specifically required for BCR signaling that disrupt Btk function and prevent B-cell maturation a steps that require a functional BCR pathway. Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a Tec family kinase with a well-defined role in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling.;PCI-45261 inhibits the Btk enzymes and reduces production of collagen autoantibodies. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is vital for maturation of B cells. Btk regulates inflammatory arthritis by two distinct mechanisms. It blocks B cell receptor-dependent B cell proliferation and in prophylactic regimens reduces autoantibody levels in collagen-induced arthritis (autoimmune disease). In macrophages, Btk inhibition abolishes Fc gammaRIII-induced TNFa, IL-1beta and IL-6 production. Accordingly, in myeloid- and Fc gammaR-dependent autoantibody-induced autoimmune disease, it decreases cytokine levels and ameliorates disease.

Piroxicam is an oxicam derivative and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is used to reduce the pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Piroxicam inhibits cylooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Piroxicam-PC targets cyclooxygenase (1 and 2) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) that make prostaglandins. The drug candidate is based on the PlxGuard technology in which the NSAID is pre-associated with phosphatidylcholine. This technology allows the same effective dose of the NSAID to reach its site of action in the body, while significantly reducing the chances of GI damage.;Piroxicam inhibits cylooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which leads to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Piroxicam works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. Piroxicam also inhibits the migration of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and prevents the formation of thromboxane A2, an aggregating agent, by the platelets. This NSAID-PC pre-association effectively sequesters the NSAID in a phospholipid envelope, allowing the NSAID to reach the blood stream without disrupting the GI lining.

The drug candidate is administered through oral and topical routes of administration. PrC-210 is the prototype product of new family of low molecular weight aminothiols.;PrC-210 offers protection from radiation toxicity by exerting cytotoxic effects through direct action by imparting energy to electrons that damage DNA directly and indirect action by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals which can damage cells, proteins and DNA. Gap 1 (G1) phase in cell cycle is the interval between mitosis and DNA replication that is characterized by cell growth and replication of DNA occurs during the synthesis (S) phase. PrC-210 acts by scavenging oxygen free radicals produced by the radiation and completely protects supercoiled plasmid DNA against reactive oxygen species-induced damage. It reversibly binds to deoxy ribonucleic acid to create a reversible G1/S phase cell cycle block which halts the replication of DNA for a shorter period of time.;" A preclinical study was carried out to test PrC-210 for orally conferred radio protection in rat and mouse models.

Casein kinase I (CK1) is involved in the phosphorylation of Tau protein. Over expression of CK1 delta leads to granulovacuolar bodies and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Hyper-phosphorylation of Tau causes release of Tau from microtubules and is typical in AD tissue. Tau protein in normal healthy brain tissue is its structural role in stabilizing the scaffold of the cell through binding to microtubules, which is mediated by the phosphorylation state of Tau. The drug candidates thus act by blocking the phosphorylation of tau protein thus preventing the formation of neurofibrillary deposits.;" In December 2012, Proteome Sciences Plc reported that in-vivo study showed CK1D inhibitors improve cognition in Alzheimer’s model.

The structure activity relationship (SAR) modelling of the most active and selective CK1d inhibitors has produced a marked improvement in activity and selectivity against the main anti-target. Following successful in silico modelling and screening of CK1d a panel of over 600 candidate compounds were identified. After the first round of SAR two compounds were shown to knock down levels of Tau phosphorylation in a human neuronal cell line model over-expressing Tau protein, as measured using proprietary pTau 2.0 & 3.0 assays that measures phospho- and total Tau in murine brain or in human and murine cultured cells.; In July 2013, Proteome Sciences plc announced that it would be making six poster presentations at the upcoming Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.

When the tau protein of treated animals was analysed a decrease was seen at key sites in total tau deposition and in tau phosphorylation and also the treatment, has caused a dramatic drop in the amount of the target protein in the brain.

";RO-28-1675 was under development for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. RO-28-1675 administered through oral route. It was a small molecule glucokinase activator 1. Glucokinase is a member of the hexokinase family of enzymes that are responsible for the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate for further utilization in cells. The enzyme plays a key role in glucose homeostasis. Phosphorylation of glucose by glucokinase in the liver promotes glycogen synthesis, while in the beta-cell it results in insulin release. Activators of glucokinase increase the sensitivity of the enzyme to glucose, leading to increased insulin secretion and liver glycogen synthesis and a decrease in liver glucose output.;Ro-28-1675 is a glucokinase activator 1. Glucokinase catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism in pancreatic cells and liver. It exists as a monomer in three conformations that control catalytic function: a closed form, an open form, and a super open form. Transitions between these conformations are controlled by glucose concentration, giving a sigmoidal enzyme activity curve, as well as by allosteric modulators. Binding of novel glucokinase activator molecules, such as RO0281675, to the allosteric site increases glucokinase activity, resulting in both augmented hepatic glucose uptake and lowering of the cell threshold for glucose stimulated insulin release. In the liver, glucokinase enzyme activity is inhibited by binding of glucokinase regulatory protein, which also leads to nuclear sequestration of the enzyme. Glucokinase serves a critical physiological function as the cell glucose sensor. It determines the glucose threshold for insulin release because of the low affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.;" GKAs have reduced blood glucose in several animal models of type 2 diabetes. RO-28-1675 was the first GKA noted to reduce blood glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test in several models of type 2 diabetes in rodents. This compound also lowered basal glucose in diet-induced obese mice, which underwent fasting for 2 hours; an accompanying rise in insulin was also noted.

RVX-2135 inhibited BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 dual bromodomains binding to acetylated histones in vitro with sub to low micromolar IC50 values. In the human AML cell line MV4-11, RVX-2135 displaced BET proteins from chromatin and significantly reduced expression of c-MYC and BCL-2 mRNAs, with IC50s of 4 and 5 µM, respectively. RVX-2135 inhibited proliferation of cultured MV4-11 cells with an IC50 value of 6 µM, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In vivo, nude mice bearing MV4-11 xenografts were treated orally with RVX-2135 at doses of 75 and 120 mg/kg b.i.d, and showed tumor growth inhibition of 77 and 92% respectively. There was a corresponding inhibition of c-MYC and BCL-2 mRNA expression in the xenograft tumors. In combination therapy in vitro, RVX-2135 synergized with idarubicin and cytarabine, with Chou-Talalay’s combination indices of 0.17 and 0.18, respectively. The synergistic effect also translated into increased apoptosis when cytarabine was combined with RVX-2135. Similar data were seen with BET inhibitors from different chemical scaffolds, suggesting that this may represent a promising new class of drugs for AML.; Resverlogix Corp. was engaged in the development of RVX-2135 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

In the published study titled ""Role of Leaky Neuronal Ryanodine Receptors in Stress-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction,"" mice were given an orally available, brain-penetrant Rycal, known as S107, prior to and during a chronic stress protocol.  The results of behavioral tests demonstrated that stressed mice have cognitive dysfunction manifested as impaired learning and memory, increased anxiety and reduced spontaneous exploratory activity as compared to untreated control mice.  Mice treated with S107 showed significant improvement in all tested measures, including learning and memory, essentially becoming indistinguishable from normal unstressed mice.  In addition, direct electrophysiological assessment of the hippocampus showed that stressed mice had impaired neuronal signaling measured by reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), which was significantly improved after treatment with S107.; In August 2012, Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) researchers have identified a potential medical treatment for the cognitive effects of stress-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study, conducted in a PTSD mouse model, shows that an experimental drug called S107, one of a new class of small-molecule compounds called Rycals, prevented learning and memory deficits associated with stress-related disorders. In the study for the sarcopenia, 24-month-old mice (roughly the equivalent of 70-year-old humans) were given S107 for four weeks. The mice showed significant improvements in both muscle force and exercise capacity, compared with untreated controls. The drug had no effect on younger mice with normal ryanodine receptors.; In March 2006, ARMGO Pharma, Inc., has obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Columbia University to the ryanodine receptor technology discovered by the company’s scientific founder, Dr Andrew R.

The drug candidate is administered orally. SAR-020106 acts by targeting Chk1.;SAR-020106 acts as checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1) Inhibitor. Involvement of Chk1 in the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint provides a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, involving targeted inhibition of Chk1. Upon DNA damage, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is stabilized and activated to give a p53-dependent G1 arrest, leading to apoptosis or DNA repair. The p53-deficient cells fail to arrest at the G1/S checkpoint in order to undergo apoptosis or DNA repair making them more reliant on the G2/M checkpoint for viability and replication fidelity.;" In February 2015, Sareum reported that the CHK1 programme developing in collaboration with CRT Pioneer Fund, is on the edge of toxicology studies. If successful, a clinical trial application will be made to the UK regulator, MHRA. If this is approved, human trials in cancer patients would then be initiated. In December 2014, Sareum reported that announcement the relationship between BACIT and the Cancer Research Technology Pioneer Fund (“CPF”) will expand, Sareum's 27.5 per cent share of the CHK1 programme will remain unchanged. Further, they reporeted that the CHK1 pre-clinical development programme remains on-track. In August 2011, the Company announced the selection of a preclinical development candidate, after positive model studies in collaboration with its partners. In November 2011, the data on the discovery of programme inhibitors and the performance of an advanced lead in model systems was published in poster presentations at the AACR-NCI-EORTC conference in the US. In summary, the programme Chk1 inhibitor dosed orally and in combination with the chemotherapeutics, gemcitabine and irinotecan, was significantly more effective in in vivo tumour models of colon and lung than the chemotherapeutic dosed alone. CRT is offering prospective commercial partners global rights to the Chk1 program on an exclusive basis for all fields. There is a strong patent portfolio protecting the lead series and surrounding chemical space, including the preclinical candidate. In October 2009, Sareum and Cancer Research Technology Limited (“CRT”) announced the publication of the latest results from their joint research collaboration with The Institute of Cancer Research (“The ICR”). The company reported that a poster entitled “Biological Properties of the Novel Chk1 Inhibitor SAR-020106” will be presented at the National Cancer Research Institute (“NCRI”) Cancer Conference, which is being held in Birmingham, UK. This drug candidate, developed by Sareum and The ICR, can produce up to 2-fold increases in the efficacy of marketed cancer chemotherapeutics. The science that leads to the development of this compound was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. This paper describes how Sareum's expertise in fragment and structure-based drug discovery combined with cancer biology and medicinal chemistry expertise at The Institute successfully identified novel inhibitors of Chk1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1). The Cancer Research Technology Pioneer Fund CPF), BACIT Limited BACIT), and Sareum Limited Sareum), entered into an agreement to co fund the further development of a class of cancer drugs called CHK1 inhibitors. The candidate inhibitor originates from research in the Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, by scientists funded by Cancer Research UK working alongside Sareum's researchers, and in collaboration with Cancer Research Technology CRT). The rights to the preclinical programme have been licensed into CPF from CRT and the ICR.

CRT and the originating research partners, Sareum and the ICR, are entitled to an upfront fee plus success milestone and royalty payments. Financial terms of the licence are not disclosed.; In this study, they analyzed whether additional abrogation of the G2/M checkpoint by the checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitor SAR-020106 (SAR) may further enhance tumor cell death in human p53-mutant glioblastoma cells when combined with ionizing radiation (IR). Additionally, they examined the potential neurotoxicity of this combination in a murine hippocampal tissue slice model. SAR induced apoptosis, reduced the vital cell count and the metabolic activity of T98G cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but had only minor effects on cell cycle distribution and proliferation. In combination experiments, SAR reversed the IR-induced proliferation by overriding the G2/M arrest. SAR (0.125 µM) resulted in a 7-fold, irradiation in a 40-fold, and combination of both in a 128-fold reduction of clonogenic survival compared to untreated cells. Neither SAR nor IR or their combination did induce neurotoxicity in nestin-positive neural progenitor cells.; Sareum announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued notification of a grant of a patent (US 8,618,121 ) for one of the inventions associated with the CHK1 cancer programme.

SC-144 is a small-molecule that targets gp130. it is administered by oral route.;SC144 binds gp130, induces gp130 phosphorylation (S782) and deglycosylation. STAT3 is a cancer transcriptional node activating several prosurvival and proliferation genes. The activation of IL-6/gp130 also promotes the activation of the RAS and PI3K pathways. The drug acts as a cytotoxic agent via a mechanism involving the inhibition of gp130 activity, leading to the inactivation of Akt and Stat3 as well as the suppression of Stat3-regulated gene expression. As a result, SC144 treatment causes cell-cycle arrest, anti-angiogenesis, and apoptosis which may check the progression of cancer.;" In July 2006, University of Southern California received The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) award for two projects. One of the project was “Preclinical Development of SC144 in Metastatic Colon Cancer."" A PCT application no PCT/US2005/039687 titled "" Novel compounds for treatment of cancer and disorders associated with angiogenesis function "" was filed in November 2005. ; SC144 shows greater potency in human ovarian cancer cell lines than in normal epithelial cells. In addition, SC144 shows potent inhibition of gp130 ligand-triggered signaling. In vivo, SC144 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of human ovarian cancer via i.p. or p.o. administration. After SC144 treatment for two months, gp130, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, MMP-7 and Ape1/Ref-1 protein levels were substantially decreased in the tumor site in the treatment group compared with the control group. The results further suggest gp130 is a novel drug target for ovarian cancer therapy, and the development of small molecule inhibitors of gp130 can help interrogate this unique signaling pathway in human diseases. SC144 exhibited potent cytotoxicity against a panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell lines. SC144 showed synergism with both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin when cotreated in colorectal cancer HT29 cells. Pretreatment with SC144 in oxaliplatin-resistant HTOXAR3 cells was more effective than oxaliplatin pretreatment. In addition, the combination of SC144 and paclitaxel exhibited synergism in MDA-MB-435 cells with a schedule-dependent block in cell cycle. In an MDA-MB-435 mouse xenograft model, coadministration of SC144 and paclitaxel delayed tumor growth in an SC144 dose-dependent manner. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of SC144 revealed that intraperitoneal administration of SC144 showed a two-compartmental pharmacokinetics elimination profile that was not observed in the oral dosing. Athymic nude mice implanted with MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with the indicated doses of SC144 by daily i.p. administration for five-days. To study the molecular anticancer mechanism of SC144, it was found that it arrested cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells, which is associated with the decrease in cyclin D1 expression and the activation of the p38/IL-24/Fas pathway. Additionally, in surgical specimens from 202 colorectal patients, Cyclin D1 expression was significantly higher and IL-24 expression was significantly lower in cancer tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa, and there was a significant correlation between IL-24 level in colorectal cancer tissue and the survival rate of patients after cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.007). This clinical evidence supported that SC144 was a promising therapeutic agent for colon cancer therapy.; The University of Southern California was investigating SC-144 for the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer.

SCH-206272 is a selective antagonist of tachykinin (NK) NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors. It inhibits substance P-induced airway microvascular leakage. Tachykinin NK(1) receptors is a G protein coupled receptor expressed in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous system. The drug candidate is administered orally.;SCH-206272 acts through antagonizing the tachykinin (NK) NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors. In asthma and chronic obstructive diseases tachykinins mediate their effects by stimulation of tachykinin NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors. NK1 receptors are mainly involved in neurogenic inflammation (microvascular leakage and mucus secretion). NK2 receptors are important in smooth muscle contraction. NK3 receptors in the airways play an important role in localized neural regulation of airflow to the lungs. The activation of tachykinin (NK) NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors by substance P binding to tachykinin (NK) receptors secretion of various cytokines  are interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8. SCH-206272 inhibits the binding of tachykinin (NK) NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors and inhibits the activation of receptor leads to stop microvascular leakage, scretion of cytokines and mucus.;" Pre-clinical study showed that oral SCH 206272 (0.1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited substance P-induced airway microvascular leakage and neurokinin A-induced bronchospasm in the guinea pig. In a canine in vivo model SCH 206272 (0.1-3 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited NK(1) and NK(2) activities induced by exogenous substance P and neurokinin A. Furthermore, in guinea pig models involving endogenously released tachykinins, SCH 206272 inhibited hyperventilation-induced bronchospasm, capsaicin-induced cough, and airway microvascular leakage induced by nebulized hypertonic saline. These data showed that SCH 206272 is a potent, orally active tachykinin NK(1), NK(2), and NK(3) receptor antagonist. This compound may have beneficial effects in diseases mediated by tachykinins, such as cough, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.; Schering-Plough Research Institute (Merck) was engaged in the development of SCH-206272 for treatment of bronchospasm, cough, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The drug candidate is administered orally. SD-208 is a transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 kinase inhibitor. The activated T helper cells and lymphocytes play a critical role in disease initiation and progression by elaborating an array of inflammatory cytokines that deregulate normal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. The key signal to suppress keratinocyte growth is the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) protein, the expression of which is documented to be increased in psoriatic patients.;SD-208 is a transforming growth factor beta receptor-1 kinase inhibitor. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling is significantly deregulated in psoriasis. TGF-beta is a multifunctional growth factor that exists as three different subtypes: TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3. The molecular action of TGF-beta starts at the cell surface, where a soluble TGF-beta1 peptide engages its cognate TGF-beta RII receptor on the keratinocyte and induces a confirmation change. TGF-beta RII is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase, on binding the TGF-beta, phosphorylates TGF-beta RI kinase. The activated TGF-beta RI subsequently propagates the signaling intracellularly by phosphorylating SMA D2 and SMA D3 proteins. On phosphorylation, SMA D2 and SMA D3 proteins form a complex with SMA D4 protein, translocate into the nucleus, and act as transcription factors. This cascade of events results in an alteration of gene expression within the keratinocyte, leading to the inhibition of proliferation, increased differentiation, and sensitization to apoptosis.; Sosei Heptares  (formerly known as Sosei Group Corporation) was engaged in the development of SD-208 for the treatment of psoriasis.

Ligand binding to ER releases the receptor from an inhibitory complex with heat shock proteins and triggers conformational changes. Subsequently, the receptor-ligand complex is attached to co regulatory molecules and translocated into the nucleus. Inside the nuclei, this complex binds to the palindromic ERE (estrogen response element) located in the target gene promoters. Binding modulates the transcription of genes regulated by these promoters. The coregulatory molecules are either the activators or repressors and bind to the DNA to stimulate or repress the gene expression respectively. Estrogen receptors localized on the cell membrane and cytoplasm are also involved with the transduction of the nongenomic effects of estrogen. Estrogens activate GPCRs and protein kinase B pathway leading to apoptosis inhibition. In breast and prostate cancer cells, estrogen can activate the Src-Ras-ERK pathway, leading to cell cycle progression.

Inside the nuclei, this complex binds to the palindromic ERE (estrogen response element) located in the target gene promoters. Binding modulates the transcription of genes regulated by these promoters. The coregulatory molecules are either the activators or repressors and bind to the DNA to stimulate or repress the gene expression respectively. Estrogen receptors localized on the cell membrane and cytoplasm are also involved with the transduction of the nongenomic effects of estrogen. Estrogens activate GPCRs and protein kinase B pathway leading to apoptosis inhibition. In breast and prostate cancer cells, estrogen can activate the Src-Ras-ERK pathway, leading to cell cycle progression. The drug candidate binds to estrogen receptor alpha which blocks hormone action at the receptor and induces a conformational change that results in the degradation of the receptor. This might antagonize the oncogenic activities associate with ER-mediated signalling.;" Aragon has identified multiple SERDs that have pharmacokinetic profiles sufficient to drive a robust therapeutic response and result in degradation of the receptor and anti-tumor activity. The novel profile of these potent, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal agents may result in greater efficacy and response rates in patients with hormone-refractory breast cancer compared to other drugs in development. Aragon’s most advanced leads induce tumor regressions in both tamoxfen sensitive and tamoxifen resistant tumor models in vivo. Based on these results and others, the company is currently advancing multiple, distinct lead SERD chemical scaffolds toward clinical development.; Genentech was engaged in the development of SERD program for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, hormone-refractory breast cancer and it was also under development for endometrial cancer.

The drug candidate is administered orally and acts by targeting D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO). D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) is a flavoenzyme that degrades D-amino acids through the process of oxidative deamination.; SUN is a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor. DAAO inhibitors inhibit the degradation of D-serine, an amino acid which has a central role in the normal function of the glutamate/NMDA system in the human brain. DAAO helps to metabolize D-Serine and increases brain D-serine levels. Thus, the inhibitors of D-amino acid oxidase show effect by not allowing DAAO to metabolize D-serine making it available in brain in high quantity and helps to relieve the pain.;" In March 2013, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported the preclinical data that inhibition of DAAO in peripheral afferent-spinal circuits reduced spontaneous neuronal activity to attenuate pain-related behaviors in rat models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Oral SUN reduced spontaneous activity in both central and peripheral recordings at doses and pretreatment times that corresponded to reduced mechanical allodynia in behavioral experiments. Following i.v. administration of SUN, the onset of action for this central effect was rapid (maximal effects within 30 minutes), but was abolished by severing afferent inputs to the dorsal horn. In another study, oral administration of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg 4H-furo[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylic acid (SUN) produced dose-related and steady increases of cerebellum d-serine in rats and mice, indicative of lasting inhibition of central DAAO. SUN administered 2 h prior to training improved contextual fear conditioning in mice and novel object recognition memory in rats when tested 24 h after training. In anesthetized rats, LTP was established proportional to the number of TBS trains. d-cycloserine (DCS) was used to identify a submaximal level of LTP (5× TBS) that responded to NMDA receptor activation; SUN administered at 10 mg/kg 3–4 h prior to testing similarly increased in vivo LTP levels compared to vehicle control animals. Interestingly, in vivo administration of DCS also increased brain d-serine concentrations. These results indicate that DAAO inhibition increased NMDAR-related synaptic plasticity during phases of post training memory consolidation to improve memory performance in hippocampal-dependent behavioral tests.; Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. was developing SUN for the treatment of memory impairment, neuropathic and inflammatory pain.

The drug candidate is small-molecule administered orally. NO is a small gaseous molecule with chemical properties that make it uniquely suitable as both an intra- and intercellular messenger. Too little or too much nitric oxide (NO) production contributes to numerous human diseases and disorders. Conditions such as hemorrhagic shock, tissue rejection, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes are associated with the overproduction of NO. Nitric oxide neutralizers for diabetes decrease cell infiltration, delays the onset of disease and decrease the incidence of hyperglycemia. The drug candidate is developed on nitric oxide (NO) blocker technology.;Nitric oxide neutralizers is an anti diabetic agent. Nitric oxide (NO) overproduction is a feature common to many medical problems and disorders, causes molecular damage that leads to disease-causing cellular dysfunction. The drug candidate is based on NO neutralizers, a unique pharmaceutical technology that removes the excess pathology-causing NO while preserving the basal beneficial levels of NO. In pathological conditions, such as in diabetes, impaired NO activity may be present. NO neutralizers bind nitric oxide very tightly and with great specificity. The bound NO is thus inactivated and prevented from participating in pathology-causing reactions.;" Medinox has shown proof of concept in key animal models of type 2 diabetes, such as the ob/ob mouse and the Zucker rat. These proof of concept studies demonstrate the potential for Medinox's NO compounds to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes. n animal models, it has been shown that excessively produced NO can stimulate apoptosis that mediates the loss of insulin-producing beta cells. In addition, inflammatory responses in the pancreas can induce a state of insulin resistance in the beta cell that leads to a NO-dependent shutdown of metabolism, resulting in beta cell dysfunction.; Medinox, Inc was engaged in the development of nitric oxide neutralizers for the treatment of type II diabetes.

The drug candidate is administered orally. It is a rapamycin analog. It mainly targets erythropoietin (epo). The drug candidate is based on ARGENT (cell-signaling regulation technology or Arid regulated gene therapy) technology.;Small molecule is an erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) agonist. The drug candidate is principally engaged to help in overcoming problems caused by erythropoietin. Epo is produced by the peritubular capillary endothelial cells in the kidney, and is the hormone that regulates red blood cell production. Inadequate levels of epo mainly results in anemia. The drug candidate exhibits herapeutic action by stimulating the proliferation and survival of red blood cells.;" &lt;p&gt;RegenxBio Inc., announced that it intends to offer and sell, subject to market conditions, USD175 million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering.&nbsp; The company intends to use the proceeds: (i) advance RGX-314 program, including expansion of the Phase I clinical trial with an additional dose cohort, initiation of a Phase II clinical trial and potential future development of expanded indications; (ii) development of RGX-501, including continued dose-escalation studies in its Phase I/II trial; (iii) fund the Phase I and Phase I/II clinical trials for RGX-111 and RGX-121, respectively; (iv) fund the conduct of preclinical studies to support the filing an IND for an additional internal program in 2019; (v) further build its manufacturing processing and analytics capabilities to support its ongoing and anticipated product development efforts, and in anticipation of potential registration studies for its lead product candidates; (vi) continue the development of internal early-stage research and development infrastructure to support other retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative preclinical programs and to advance additional product candidates into clinical development; (vii) opportunistically grow the pipeline of new product candidates through in-licenses or potential acquisitions; (viii) to establish its initial commercial infrastructure in anticipation of future potential commercial launches; and (ix) to working capital, general and administrative expenses or other corporate obligations.&lt;/p&gt;; Ariad had conducted a study of AP-22594 in monkeys in 2002. The monkeys received an injection of a specially designed, dormant form of the EPO gene into muscle only once at the onset of the study. Numerous times since then, equivalent amounts of EPO protein were produced in response to the same dose of ARIAD's AP-22594. Conversely, different doses of AP-22594 consistently increased circulating levels of EPO and red blood cells directly in proportion to the amount of the drug administered. From this comprehensive study, ARIAD anticipated that AP-22594 may be given intermittently to patients as an easy-to-swallow pill. It also anticipated that the dose of AP-22594 may be adjusted to produce whatever level of EPO is needed to provide optimal treatment of anemia for each patient depending on the patient's clinical status, and the patented gene complex may be injected only once providing at least four years of chronic treatment. AP-22594 is approximately 100-fold less immunosuppressive than rapamycin when administered daily in a mouse skin allograft rejection assay. However, the 2 drugs induce Epo expression with equal potency in primates. AP-22594-induced expression was dose dependent, with a maximal response obtained with an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg. Epo expression could also be induced by orally administered AP-22594; like rapamycin, AP-22594 exhibited approximately 10% oral bioavailability. For example, administration of a 0.45-mg dose orally gave a similar response to 0.045 mg/kg administered intravenously. In January 2003, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals announced the issuance of a U.S. patent covering intramuscular administration of therapeutic genes controlled by ARIAD's cell-signaling regulation technology - the product concept being used in ARIAD's erythropoietin (EPO) anemia product candidate. A specially designed, dormant form of the EPO gene was injected into muscle at the onset of treatment, followed by oral administration of ARIAD's patented, small molecule-drug, AP-22594, once or twice a month, to increase circulating levels of EPO and red blood cells directly in proportion to the amount of AP-22594 administered. This newly issued patent further strengthened the company’s intellectual property portfolio for orally regulated protein therapy and specifically covered their EPO product candidate to treat anemia. The filing of IND to initiate clinical studies was planned in 2003. There is no further information available for the drug.; In February 2009, RegenxBio Inc. entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for patent and other intellectual property rights relating to a gene therapy technology platform based on certain newly recombinant AAV vectors discovered at Penn in the laboratory of our Chief Scientific Advisor, James M.

As of May 2012, the drug candidates were in preclinical stage of development.; The company reported a study of design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of novel spiro-piperidines as acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors. The scientists reported that they modified the spiro-lactone ring and the benzothiophene portion of the molecule. Spiro-imide derivative 8c containing a 6-methylthieno[2,3-b]pyridine core exhibited potent ACC inhibitory activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in rats. In April 2012, the company reported a study of symmetrical approach of spiro-pyrazolidinediones as acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors. The scientists reported that spiro-pyrazolidinedione derivatives without quaternary chiral center were discovered by structure-based drug design and characterized as potent acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors. The high metabolic stability of the spiro-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyridazine scaffold and enhancement of the activity by incorporation of a 7-methoxy group on the benzothiophene core successfully led to the identification of compound 4c as an orally bioavailable and highly potent ACC inhibitor. Oral administration of 4c significantly decreased the values of the respiratory quotient in rats, indicating the stimulation of fatty acid oxidation.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;19-May-2012;;;;

He sold DNA supercoiling inhibitors to Biota Holdings. Later in November 2009, Biota Holdings acquired Prolysis Limited. Biota developed PC-190723 (derivative of 3-methoxybenzamide) based on DNA supercoiling inhibitors. Now, Dr Lloyd Czaplewski FRSC is the founder and director of Abgentis which focuses on broad-spectrum IV/oral antibacterial to treat acute and chronic, life-threatening and drug-resistant infections using structure-activity relationships, microbiology, pharmacology and efficacy of antibacterial DNA supercoiling inhibitors. Abgentis developed Compound-1 which is the optimized lead derivative of 3-methoxybenzamine.; In November 2012, Abgentis Limited reported the optimization of 3-methoxybenzamide derivatives towards a drug candidate. The in vitro and in vivo characterization of a more advanced lead compound was described in the study. Compound 1 was potently antibacterial, with an average MIC of 0.12 µg/mL against all staphylococcal species, including methicillin- and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Compound 1 inhibited a S. aureus strain carrying the G196A mutation in FtsZ, which confers resistance to PC190723 (derivative of 3-methoxybenzamide). No interactions between Compound 1 and a diverse panel of antibiotics were measured in checkerboard experiments. Compound 1 displayed suitable in vitro pharmaceutical properties and a favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic profile following intravenous and oral administration, with a calculated bioavailability of 82 percent in mice. Compound 1 demonstrated efficacy in the murine S. aureus systemic model of infection and caused a significant decrease in bacterial load in the thigh infection model. A greater reduction in the number of S. aureus cells recovered from infected thighs, equivalent to 3.68 log versus controls, was achieved using a succinate pro-drug of Compound 1, designated Compound 2.

The drug candidates are administered orally. Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. It consists of three different types of protein molecules (C, prM and E) forming the virus particle. For infection of virus, cleavage of viral proteins by furin is essential. Therefore inhibiting furin enzyme suppresses viral infection.;Furin inhibitors exhibit anti-viral properties. Generally proteins are inactive when first synthesized, and must have few amino acids removed in order to become active. Furin deletes these sections and activates the proteins. The envelope proteins of dengue fever virus utilize this specific property of furin for infection. The viral envelope proteins C, prM and E undergo conformational changes due to the low pH in the lumen of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Prior to the final release of the virions, prM is cleaved by the host cell furin endoprotease, into associated M and a soluble peptide. This makes host susceptible for infection.

RecA pairs ssDNA with homologous duplex DNA, and hydrolyzes ATP to induce the conformational rearrangements necessary to catalyze a strand exchange reaction that produces two new DNA molecules. ATPase-dependent activity is necessary for recombinational DNA repair and horizontal gene transfer during bacterial transformation, transduction and conjugation.;" In April 2010, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Synereca Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed the first Carolina Express License. The Carolina Express License is a license agreement created by the University last December to foster more new spin-out companies that result from academic research conducted on campus. Under the Carolina Express License, Synereca will license inventions resulting from research conducted by Associate Professor Scott F. Singleton from the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy. Singleton’s research addresses the growing problem of bacterial resistance to current antibiotics. Synereca aims to develop orally active drugs that sustain the efficacy of existing antibiotics by inhibiting the bacterial enzyme RecA.; Synereca is a spin-out of Dr. Singleton’s RecA inhibitor program originating at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.In March 2006, University of North Carolina filed a patent application (EP20060737375) entitled ""Inhibitors of reca activities for control of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens."" the invention relates to the compounds for modulating RecA protein activity are provided.In December 2015, Synereca Pharmaceuticals, Inc Inc filed a patent with the application number (PCT/US2015/065111) entitled “Heterocyclic compounds as antibiotic Potentiators”. he invention relates to heterocyclic compounds and their use as antibiotics and/or as antibiotic potentiators.

As of February 2018, the drug candidates were in preclinical stage of development.; Synereca Pharmaceuticals, Inc . announced that it has raised USD 1.4 million in a venture financing round. The Company also announced that it intends to use the proceeds to advance its research focused on compounds to potentiate the effectiveness of existing antibiotics against drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.; Synereca reported the identification of prototypical RecA inhibitors that potentiate the killing of E. coli by a number of conventional antibacterial agents, resulting in the following significant changes like increased fraction of a bacterial population that is killed by a given dose of an antibacterial, reduced dose of an antibacterial required to achieve a targeted killing rate and reduced MIC. Further preliminary results suggest that the prototypic RecA inhibitors are effective against a number of pathogenic bacteria, including those responsible for lung, urinary tract, and skin infections, as well as weaponizable Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Company revealed that the RecA-activated SOS response specifically enhnaced the bacteria’s survival of antibacterial-induced free radicals. Bacterial strains lacking RecA function were highly sensitized to antibacterial agents (i.e., minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) are reduced = 10-fold). Moreover, mice infected with E. coli having suppressed SOS networks survive the infection significantly more frequently than mice infected by unsuppressed bacteria. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a cell-permeable small molecule that inhibits RecA could act as a strong adjuvant for traditional antibacterial chemotherapies by increasing the therapeutic index. Synereca’s scientific founder and his colleagues developed assays and reagents for the high-volume screening of chemical libraries for inhibitors of RecA. A recent screen of 33,600 compounds yielded five separate chemical classes of RecA inhibitors. Singleton furthermore demonstrated that combining a prototypic RecA inhibitor with the following antibiotics potentiates bacterial killing: ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and mitomycin C.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;08-Feb-2018;;;;

The patent is also published with applications CA2848006A1, CN103906523A, DE102011112898A1, EP2753340A1and US20140248363.; The scientists discovered a concept of nanocrystalline phosphate-adsorbing maghemite (C-PAM) of which two products D-mannose (C-PAM-10) or mannitol (C-PAM-11) were synthesized and evaluated for their phosphate adsorption and physicochemical properties. The products were characterized by TEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The studies showed that they exhibited optimal phosphate-adsorbing properties with minor release of iron ions over a wide pH range. The vitro studies showed that the iron particles (C-PAM) had better phosphate adsorption capacity than other iron based adsorbents. The in-vivo studies conducted in rats showed that C-PAM lowered the serum phosphate level.The university states that the developed nanocrystalline maghemite C-PAM-11 showed high phosphate-adsorbing capacity that can be enhanced further by an appropriate galenic formulation without increasing the release of free iron ions. C-PAM-11 was given with food for four weeks in sprague Dawley rats that resulted in reduced phosphate serum level compared to control or reneval.  C-PAM-11 treated rats lowered the levels of phosphate indicating the intestinal phosphate adsorbing efficacy of the maghemite nanoparticles.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;08-May-2013;;;;

The drug candidate exhibit therapeutic intervention by blocking HIV replication and its entry into CD4+ T lymphocytes.;SP-10 works by antagonizing CCR5 and inhibits the replication of CCR5- and CXCR4. It is an anti-retroviral therapeutic agent that targets a host cell protein instead of a viral enzyme. CCR5 and CXCR4 play an essential role in HIV pathogenesis. The drug candidate works by interfering with the actin polymerization/depolymerization dynamic that result in the reduction of CD4 and CCR5 cell surface density, thereby checking the progression of the disease. Thus SP-10, a entry inhibitor, targets all mechanism of viral entry and could be effective in the treatment of HIV infection.;" In May 2004, Samaritan Pharmaceuticals filed a patent application no (PCT/US2004/015791) titled “Anti-hiv benzamide compounds” The present invention relates to a therapeutic method for preventing or treating a pathological condition or symptom in a mammal, such as a human, wherein the infectivity of a pathogen such as a retrovirus toward mammalian cells is implicated and inhibition of its infectivity is desired comprising administering to a mammal in need of such therapy, an effective amount of an N-benzamide derivative of a piperazinyl amide of an amino thereof that inhibits pathogenic infectivity, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.; Samaritan Pharmaceuticals was engaged in the development of SP-10 for the treatment of HIV.  As of August 2011, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development. The Securities and Exchange Commission revoked registration of registered securities of Samaritan Pharmaceuticals.; SP-10 is an anti-retroviral therapeutic that has demonstrated promise in pre-clinical studies due to its efficacy, favorable safety profile, and promising resistance profile. SP-10 inhibited the replication of CCR5- and CXCR4-sensitive HIV-1 viral strains in vitro in engineered HeLa cells expressing CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 and in peripheral blood monuclear cells. When the host cells where pre-incubated with SP-10 prior to viral infection, SP-10 efficacy was comparable to the classic antiviral agent AZT. Pre-incubation of MAGI-HeLa cells with SP-10 resulted in a decrease of CD4 and CCR5 receptors expression at the cell surface but did not modify the total CD4/CCR5 protein amount present in the cell. As a consequence, gp120 binding on the cell membrane was significantly inhibited. The reduction of the density of these specific receptors at the cell surface was associated to an alteration of the actin accumulation and a reduction of F-actin filaments formation near the cell surface suggesting that SP-10 interference with the actin polymerization/depolymerization dynamic was a key element in the reduction of CD4 and CCR5 cell surface density. In addition, SP-10 also decreased cholesterol uptake and also the expression of the cholesterol synthesis key enzyme HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in the cells. This effect is purported to induce a modification of the host cell lipid enriched raft composition and membrane fluidity which in turn would lead to an alteration of recruitment of the receptors used by HIV to enter the cell. The fact that SP-10 aims at several targets that are specific of the host cell and not of the virus itself supports the idea that it will be very difficult for the virus to develop resistance. The inhibition of the multi-drug resistant HIV-1 MDR769 replication by SP-10 further supports this claim. In addition SP-10 demonstrated a very low toxicity profile in-vitro.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;15-Aug-2011;;;;

Gamma-secretase is a multisubunit protease complex. It is the administerdthrough oral route.;SPI-1865 is an anti-alzheimer's agent. The drug candidate (gamma secretase modulators) decreases the clevage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the site that generates 42-amino acid amyloid beta protein (Abeta42). Modulating gamma secretase has the potential to effectively and selectively lower levels of Abeta42 which is involved in amyloid beta plaques. The Alzheimers disease (AD) pathophysiology postulates that Abeta, particularly the Abeta42 isoform, initiates a neurotoxic cascade that lbetaads to amyloid deposition, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Abeta species are formed through a series of enzymatic cleavages of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), initially by either alpha secretase (a-secretase) or beta secretase (beta-secretase). The beta-secretase cleavage is cleaved further by gama secretase to produce the neurotoxic Abeta42 peptide.;" In July 2006, Satori Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was awarded research grant of USD 100,000 from National Institute on Aging (1R43AG026865-01) for the project entitled “Beta-Amyloid 1-42 Lowering Agent for Alzheimer's disease”.; Satori Pharmaceuticals Inc. was developing SPI-1865 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. As of  May 2013, the drug candidate was in a pre-clinical stage of development.; SPI-1865 was being evaluated in GLP-toxicology studies in rodent and non-rodent species. SPI-1865 has been tested in multiple in vivo models. Whether administered orally as a single dose or for multiple days, the compound is capable of lowering brain Aß42. This has been observed in wild type mice, rats and transgenic mice (Tg2576) which over-express amyloid precursor protein resulting in high levels of Aß peptides. The compound has been shown to have good brain penetration and a long half-life that permits once a day dosing in Alzheimer's patients.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;30-May-2013;;;;

Dopamine antagonism restores the hyperactivity of dopamine transmission responsible for the disorder. Full agonists of 5-HT1A receptors stimulate both pre- and postsynaptic receptor whereas drugs of intermediate efficacy preferentially activate 5-HT1A autoreceptors while blocking their postsynaptic counterparts. Stimulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors activates frontocortical dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways by suppressing their tonic inhibition by 5-HT2C sites. Reduction of activity at 5-HT2C sites is also involved in their anxiolytic properties and glutamatergic and cholinergic activity.

Renin is an enzyme that plays a major role in the renin-angiotensin system, a regulatory system in the body, which is responsible to maintain homeostasis of blood pressure. The enzyme belongs to the family of aspartic proteases and is responsible for the conversion of inactive angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). Angiotensin I by itself is inactive. However, when acted upon by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) it gets converted to angiotensin II, which is active and is responsible for most of the pressor effects. Conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I is the rate determining step of the system. The catalytic role played by renin is thus crucial in mediating blood pressure by the renin-angiotensin system.;"SPP-1234 acts as a renin inhibitor, an enzyme that plays a major role in the renin-angiotensin system, a regulatory system in the body, which is responsible to maintain homeostasis of blood pressure. Renin is an enzyme that acts on angiotensinogen (renin substrate) to catalyze the formation of the decapeptide angiotensin I. This decapeptide is then cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to yield the octapeptide angiotensin II which is a most potent vasoconstrictor. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an important participant in both short- and long-term regulation of arterial blood pressure. It acts synergistically with the sympathetic nervous system and stimulates aldosterone secretion; it plays a central role in the control of sodium excretion and fluid volume as well as of vascular tone. Thus, abnormalities of the RAS are apparent in several forms of human hypertension, edematous states such as congestive heart failure and renal failure."; Speedel Pharmaceuticals (now Novartis) was engaged in the development of SPP1234 for the treatment of hypertension.

SSR-161421 is an adenosine A3 receptor antagonist. It was administered orally. The A3 adenosine receptor (A3R) is an important regulator of pulmonary inflammation and airway remodeling. Its levels are elevated in patients with chronic lung disease, and in pulmonary disease. A3 adenosine receptor is activated by adenosine. Afetr activation, A3 receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase through a pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-protein, probably belonging to the Gi/Go class.;SSR-161421 is an adenosine A3 receptor antagonist. A3 adenosine receptor is activated by adenosine. A3 adenosine receptor is expressed in human tissues with abundant expression in the lung and liver. Adenosine is involved in the activation of circulating and resident inflammatory cells within the lung, leading to exaggerated airway narrowing in individuals with inflammatory airway disorders. It is hypothesized that A3 receptor gene expression is localized to inflammatory cells and that gene expression is up-regulated in airway inflammation.;" Sanofi Aventis was engaged in the development of SSR-161421 for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As of December 2004, the SSR-161421 was in pre-clinical stage of development.; The effects of a adenosine A(3) receptor antagonist, SSR161421, were examined on both antigen per se and adenosine receptor agonist-increased airway responses in antigen-sensitized guinea pigs. Adenosine (10(-5)M) and AB-MECA [N6-(4-aminobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methyl-uronamide dihydrochloride] (10(-7)M) increased the antigen response up to 61  Plus/Minus  3.0% and 88  Plus/Minus  5.2% of maximal contraction, respectively.

The drug candidate is administered orally, a hormone replacement therapy. It is a natural metabolite of testosterone derived from the fetoplacental unit. The drug candidate differs from testosterone by having a hydroxyl-group at the 15-position.;Testetrol is a natural metabolite of testosterone. The drug candidate binds to the androgen receptor acting as its agonist. Circulating testosterone is chiefly bound in the serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. The albumin-bound fraction of testosterone easily dissociates from albumin and is presumed to be bioactive. The portion of testosterone bound to SHBG is not considered biologically active. The amount of SHBG in the serum and the total testosterone level determine the distribution of bioactive and nonbioactive testosterone. Testetrol, hydroxyl derivatives of testosterone has strong analogy with E4 which does not bind to SHBG and are characterized by high oral bioavailability.;" In September 2003, Pantarhei Bioscience filed a patent with application PCT/NL2003/000621entitled “Pharmaceutical application of 15- or 16- substituted testosterone analogues”. The intervention relates to pharmaceutical dosage units for oral, transmucosal or transdermal administration containing 15- or 16-substituted testosterone analogues, as well as to therapeutic methods that employ these testosterone analogues.Pantarhei is looking for a partner who is willing to develop the concept further and subsequently the commercialization.; Pantarhei Bioscience BV was engaged in the development of testetrol (T2) for the treatment of male hypogonadism. As of November 2016, The drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; The Company has confirmed the oral bioavailability of T2 by demonstrating its pharmacological effects following once daily oral administration in the Hershberger test, a standard model system for androgen activity in rats. The data generated by the company to date strongly support the further development of T2 for the oral treatment of androgen deficiency and/or insufficiency, both in men and in women. For the foreseeable future, focus is given to establishing the GMP synthesis of T2, which will be carried out by ChemShop, Weert, The Netherlands. Pantarhei has prepared a pharmacological program, focusing on androgen receptor transactivation or repression in human cell lines, oral potency versus Methyl-testosterone in SHBG-transgenic mice, metabolic stability and profile in human hepatocytes and hepatic toxicity in appropriate animal models. The toxicity profile will be tested further in a formal pre-clinical toxicity program. The Company intends to restrict its pre-clinical toxicology program to a package required to perform Phase I studies. Since the Phase I trial for T2 is likely to focus on (liver) safety, oral bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and on androgen sensitive dynamic parameters, the duration of the toxicology program for these purposes is likely to be restricted to three months treatment. The development plan comprises a three-month treatment Phase I study in humans and a multiple dose, three-month, Phase IB study in hypogonadal males.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;09-Nov-2016;;;;

The drug candidate is water-soluble triazole antifungal agent. The drug candidate act by inhibition of the cytochrome P450-dependent conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. The drug candidate is administered through oral and parenteral route.;The drug candidate is triazol which acts by inhibition of lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase preventing the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. Triazoles act as cytochrome P450 14 alpha-demethylase inhibitors. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol which is helpful in the cell wall synthesis. In this mechanism the basic nitrogen of the azole ring is tightly bound to the heme iron of the fungal cytochrome P450 preventing substrate and oxygen binding. Inhibition of the 14 alpha-demethylase results in accumulation of sterols and causes permeability change and malfunction of membrane proteins, resulted inhibition of fungal growth.;" Fujifilm Holdings Corp. announced that it has agreed to acquire additional 34 percent stake in Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd. from Taisho Pharmaceutical Holdings Co., Ltd. Upon completion of the transaction, Fujifilm will hold all the shares of Toyama Chemical making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the transaction, Fujifilm intends to merge Toyama Chemical and Fujifilm RI Pharma Co. Ltd., to form Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd. as of October 1, 2018 in order to accelerate the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic drugs. The transaction is expected to be completed by July 31, 2018.; In January 1997, the preclinical study reported the T-8581 is a new orally and parenterally active triazole antifungal agent; in vitro and in vivo evaluations. The geometric mean IC80s (GM-IC80S; where the IC80 is the lowest drug concentration which reduced the optical density at 630 nm by 80% compared with the optical density at 630 nm of the drug-free control) for Candida albicans were as follows: T-8581, 0.218 microgram per ml; fluconazole; 0.148 microgram per ml; and itraconazole, 0.0170 microgram per ml. For Cryptococcus neoformans the GM-IC80s were as follows: T-8581, 9.28 micrograms per ml; fluconazole, 4.00 micrograms per ml; and itraconazole, 0.119 microgram per ml. For Aspergillus fumigatus the GM-IC80s were as follows: T-8581, 71.0 micrograms per ml; fluconazole, 239 micrograms per ml; and itraconazole, 0.379 microgram per ml. Against systemic candidiasis in mice, the 50 percent effective doses (ED50s) of T-8581, fluconazole, and itraconazole (given orally) were 0.412, 0.392, and more than 320 mg per kg of body weight, respectively. Against systemic aspergillosis in mice, the ED50s of T-8581, fluconazole, and itraconazole (given orally) were 50.5, 138, more than 320 mg per kg, respectively. T-8581 was also efficacious when it was given parenterally (ED50, 59.2 mg per kg), while the ED50 of fluconazole given parenterally was more than 20 mg per kg. Against systemic aspergillosis in rabbits, T-8581 was more effective than fluconazole and itraconazole in prolonging the life span. The high concentrations of T-8581 were observed in the sera of mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. Species differences in half-lives and areas under the concentration-time curves were observed, with the values for mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs increasing in that order. These results suggest that T-8581 would be a potentially effective antifungal drug for oral and parenteral use.; Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd was engaged in the development of T-8581 for the treatment of aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and candidiasis. As of January 1997, the drug candidate was in pre-clinical stage of development. ";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;01-Jan-1997;;;;"Aspergillosis; Cryptococcosis"

Tacrolimus (also FK-506 or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug whose main use is after organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient's immune system and so the risk of organ rejection. It acts by reducing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This inhibits both T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. The drug candidate is being developed using bioavailability (BA) enhancing technology. The basic concept of this bioavailability enhancing technology is to improve BA through achieving both recrystallizing inhibition and stabilization by transforming insoluble drug into the amjorphous form and using biocompatible polymer. The drug candidate is administered orally.;Tacrolimus is a macrolide isolated from the fungus Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus binds to the FKBP-12 protein and forms a complex with calcium-dependent proteins, thereby inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity and resulting in decreased cytokine production.

Apricoxib is a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. COX-2 inhibition may induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. COX-related metabolic pathways might represent crucial regulators of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. The COX-2 pathway impacts several pathways involved in signaling in cancer including the erbB family of receptors. Apricoxib reverses PGE2-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and associated progression and metastasis of solid tumors. EGFRs are overexpressed in various solid human cancers including breast, head and neck, gastric, prostate, bladder, ovarian, colorectal carcinomas and glioblastomas.

THR-090717 was orally administered. It is a TNF-alpha inhibitor. THR-090717 potentates adenosine-mediated cAMP production at the adenosine A2a receptor to inhibit TNF- alpha production and reduce inflammation. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a pro-inflammatory agent which is formed in the macrophages and T cells and is responsible for joint destruction and synovitis. There are two cell-surface TNF receptors (TNFR), p55 and p75, which mediate the activity of TNF on effector cells. There are also soluble TNF receptors which act as regulators of the inflammatory response by inhibiting TNF activity.;THR-090717 may potentiate adenosine-mediated cAMP production at the adenosine A2a receptor to inhibit TNF- alpha production and reduce inflammation. The drug candidate endogenously elevates adenosine levels at sites of inflammation effectively concentrate anti-inflammatory activity at disease sites. TNF-a is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. It promotes inflammation by stimulating the release of other cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. TNF-a develops a spontaneous inflammatory arthritis resembling RA. Treatment with anti- TNF-a agent suppresses inflammation in several animal models of RA.;" The drug candidate has demonstrated good in vivo potency and a high NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) in rodents. In rodent models of arthritis, THR-090717 significantly reduces joint swelling and improves clinical score.  IC50 values for the inhibition of TNF- alpha by THR-090717 in PMA-stimulated human monocytes, LPS-stimulated human monocytes and IgG-stimulated THP-1 cells were 1.8 + 0.9 uM, 0.9 uM and 1.3 + 0.25 uM respectively.

TLK16998 alone had no effect on IR signaling in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes but, at concentrations as low as 3.2 micromol/l, enhanced the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of the IR beta-subunit and IR substrate 1, and on the amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-1. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed that the effect of TLK16998 on the IR was associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the activation loop of the beta-subunit tyrosine kinase domain. TLK16998 also increased the potency of insulin in stimulating 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with a detectable effect at 8 micromol/l and a 10-fold increase at 40 micromol/l.

As of March 2016, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; Tolero Pharmaceuticals announced that MKC4659 demonstrated a relatively select targeting profile focused on a narrow group of PTKs including significant activity against BTK with IC50 less than 25 nM. In cellular assays the compound demonstrated significant in vitro potency against B cell lymphoma cell lines, inhibiting the growth of several B cell tumor cell lines including ones unresponsive to currently known BTK inhibitors. MKC4659 showed a differential effect on B cell lymphoma, with no significant activity detected in control cells lacking detectable BTK expression. In vitro mode of action studies demonstrated that MKC4659 induces apoptosis and PARP cleavage in B cell lymphoma but not in control cells. Assays evaluating the in vitro on-target effect of compounds showed significant inhibition of the B cell receptor-mediated activation of the BTK pathway. In addition to inhibiting the phosphorylation of BTK, MKC4659 inhibited the phosphorylation of PLCgamma in several B cell lymphoma cell lines. With in vitro potency demonstrated, and PK and ADMET profiles amenable to in vivo dosing, MKC4659 was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in a xenograft model of B cell lymphoma. In vivo dosing of MKC4659 inhibited growth of DOHH2 xenograft tumors in a dose dependent manner. TP-0158 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of B-cell malignancies.

It is administered through oral route. Z-212 is a organic compound that acts by targeting Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels. The drug candidate is based on cell-based combination High Throughput Screening (cHTS) technology platform.;Z-212 uniquely acts as NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 blocker. The over expression of Nav 1.8 leads to maintenance of injury-induced neuropathic pain in the lingual nerve. By blocking NaV1.7 and Nav 1.8, the drug candidate decreases the sensory neuron excitability and reduces nociceptive sensitivity in nerve injury and inflammation conditions.;" AnaBios Corporation was developing Z-212 for the treatment of neuropathic pain. As of February 2015, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; In February 2012, Epirus biopharmaceuticals (formerly Zalicus Inc.) and Hydra Biosciences, Inc. announced that they have entered into a collaboration to advance development of Zalicus ion channel modulator product candidates for the treatment of pain. This collaboration brings together the Zalicus portfolio of novel, preclinical ion channel product candidates, representing multiple calcium and sodium channel modulators, with Hydra’s expertise in ion channel discovery and preclinical drug development. The goal of the collaboration is to advance ion channel drug candidates into clinical development for the treatment of pain.; In July 2014, Epirus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Zalicus Inc. announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Epirus will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zalicus in an all-stock transaction. Following closing, Zalicus will be re-named Epirus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., and will operate under the leadership of the Epirus.; In June 2014, Zalicus Inc. announced that it has licensed its Sodium Channel Modulator program, including intellectual property and related pipeline assets, to AnaBios Corporation in exchange for clinical milestone payments and royalties on potential future sales. Under the terms of the agreement Zalicus will be eligible to receive up to $17.2 million in clinical and regulatory milestone payments and up to 12% of net sales on any future products resulting from this license.; Zalicus has announced the publication of pre-clinical data for Z212, a novel proprietary small organic compound that acts to modulate Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels and to reduce neuropathic pain by targeting the hyper-excitability associated with chronic pain signaling pathways. Through its unique mechanism of action, Z212 has been shown to both reduce the excitability of neurons and reverse pain hypersensitivity in pre-clinical models. By targeting the sodium channels in the peripheral and central nociceptive signaling pathways through its unique mechanism of action, Z212 has the potential to become a safe and effective treatment for chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;25-Feb-2015;;;;

The drug candidate is administered orally. It acts as by targeting tachykinin receptors including neurokinin (NK)1, NK2, and NK3 receptors.;ZD-6021 is antiasthmatic agent which works through antagonism of tachykinin receptors including neurokinin (NK)1, NK2, and NK3 receptor. These receptors mediate the biological actions of tachykinins ( substance P , neurokinin A and neurokinin B) in the airways. Stimulation of the NK-1 receptor induces vasodilatation, plasma protein extravasation, mucus secretion, upregulation of adhesion molecules and stimulation of inflammatory cells such as mononuclear cells, neutrophils and mast cells. Stimulation of the NK-2 receptor mediates smooth muscle contraction. Substance P can cause degranulation of mast cells through direct activation of G proteins in the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Inhibition of tachykinin receptors results in suppression of neurogenic inflammation or inflammatory airway responses induced by tachykinins.;" AstraZeneca was engaged in development of ZD-6021 for the treatment of asthma. As of July 2001, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.; ZD6021 to guinea pigs dose dependently attenuated tracheal extravasation of plasma proteins induced by the NK1 receptor agonist and bronchoconstriction, elicited by the NK2 receptor agonist. Potency was unaffected by feeding. After oral administration of ZD6021, the time to peak activity was 150 min for the NK1 receptor and 60 min for the NK2 receptor with pharmacodynamic half-lives of 280 and 458 min, respectively. The data indicate that ZD6021 is a potent, orally active antagonist of all three tachykinin receptors. Thus compound may be useful for future studies of tachykinin-related pathology such as asthma.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;31-Jul-2001;;;;

The drug candidate was administered orally. It is an 2-one dihydroimidazopyridine derivative. The drug candidate inhibits DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity in the liver. ZNC-2381 blocks signal transduction pathway (caspase-3) of apoptosis mediated by anti-Fas antibody, thereby exhibiting therapeutic effect.;ZNC-2381 is a caspase-3-specific inhibitor. It inhibits activation of the initiator caspases that prevents cytochrome c release from mitochondria, which in turn deactivates downstream effector caspases, or to direct activation of downstream caspases. The drug candidate is a hepatoprotective agent that inhibits the increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (s-ALT) activity. The drug candidate inhibits hepatocellular apoptosis and concanavalin A-induced increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels, thereby checking the progression of the disease.;" In February 2001, Zeria Pharmaceutical Co Ltd reported effects of a hepatoprotective drug, ZNC-2381 on fas-induced hepatocellular caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in mice. ZNC-2381 when administered orally, dose-dependently inhibited the increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (s-ALT) activity 8 hour after injection of anti-Fas antibody. The results demonstrated that orally administered ZNC-2381 inhibits hepatocellular apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody and prevents the progression of hepatic injury. In May 2000, Zeria Pharmaceutical Co Ltd reported effects of ZNC-2381, on several hepatic injury models and on hepatocellular apoptosis in mice and rats. The results indicated that oral ZNC-2381 inhibits cytokine (TNF-alpha) production and cytokine-related hepatocellular apoptosis and might thus prevent different types of hepatic injury.; Zeria Pharmaceutical Co Ltd was engaged in the development of ZNC-2381 for the treatment of hepatic injury. As of February 2001, the drug candidate was in preclinical stage of development.";Inactive;Innovator;Preclinical;28-Feb-2001;;;;

The drug candidate is formulated as a pulsed release capsule and is administered orally. It acts by targeting GABA-A receptor alpha 1 subunit.;Zolpidem acts as gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) A receptor alpha 1 subunit agonist.  Activation of the GABAA receptor results in the opening of the chloride channel, allowing the flow of chloride ions through the neuronal membrane and into the neuron. The drug candidate selectively binds to alpha 1-GABA(A) receptors and confers sedative activity without producing anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and myorelaxant effects.;" In February 2007, Hospira Inc announced that it had completed the acquisition of Mayne Pharma Limited as it tied in with the firms skills in specialty generic injectible pharmaceuticals. However in November 2009, the oral pharmaceutical group of Mayne Pharma Limited was purchased from Hospira by Halcygen Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In November 2010, HalcyGen Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Mayne Pharma Group Limited, which was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange under the ASX code “MYX”.; In November 2009, Halcygen Pharmaceuticals acquired Mayne Pharma International Pty Ltd. On 17 November 2010 at the Halcygen Annual General Meeting, Halcygen Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Mayne Pharma Group Limited; Mayne Pharma Group Limited was engaged in the development of zolpidem for sedation.
